<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>Contributions to this blog are very welcome provided the guidelines below are followed:</p>

<p><em>1. Would you express your opinion so strongly if the paper had come to the opposite conclusion?</em> For example, if it had found that doing X actually did improve code quality, or that Y <em>wasn't</em> better than Z, would you write the same way?</p>

<p><em>2. Are you criticizing the paper's actual claims?</em> If it says that P holds for novices who are learning how to program, there is no point saying, "But no experienced programmer would do that!"</p>

<p><em>3. Are your criticisms of the paper's statistics numerical?</em> It's meaningless to say, "The paper's sample size is too small," without some quantification.</p>

<p><em>4. Are you employing proof by rhetoric?</em> The statement, "It's obvious that J," is verbal bullying, not proof. And many "obvious" things aren't actually true: that's why we do studies.</p>
