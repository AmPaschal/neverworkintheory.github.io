<blockquote class="abstract">
  Recommendations between colleagues are effective for encouraging
  developers to adopt better practices. Research shows these peer
  interactions are useful for improving developer behaviors, or the
  adoption of activities to help software engineers complete
  programming tasks. However, in-person recommendations between
  developers in the workplace are declining. One form of online
  recommendations between developers are pull requests, which allow
  users to propose code changes and provide feedback on
  contributions. GitHub, a popular code hosting platform, recently
  introduced the suggested changes feature, which allows users to
  recommend improvements for pull requests. To better understand this
  feature and its impact on recommendations between developers, we
  report an empirical study of this system, measuring usage,
  effectiveness, and perception. Our results show that suggested
  changes support code review activities and significantly impact the
  timing and communication between developers on pull requests. This
  work provides insight into the suggested changes feature and
  implications for improving future systems for automated developer
  recommendations, such as providing situated, concise, and actionable
  feedback.
