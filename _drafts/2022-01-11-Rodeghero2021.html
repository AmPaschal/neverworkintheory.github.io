<blockquote class="abstract">
  The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the way that software development
  teams onboard new hires. Previously, most software developers worked
  in physical offices and new hires onboarded to their teams in the
  physical office, following a standard onboarding process. However,
  when companies transitioned employees to work from home due to the
  pandemic, there was little to no time to develop new onboarding
  procedures. In this paper, we present a survey of 267 new hires at
  Microsoft that onboarded to software development teams during the
  pandemic. We explored their remote onboarding process, including the
  challenges that the new hires encountered and their social
  connectedness with their teams. We found that most developers
  onboarded remotely and never had an opportunity to meet their
  teammates in person. This leads to one of the biggest challenges
  faced by these new hires, building a strong social connection with
  their team. We use these results to provide recommendations for
  onboarding remote hires.
