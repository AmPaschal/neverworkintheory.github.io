<blockquote class="abstract">
  The large amount of third-party packages available in fast-moving
  software ecosystems, such as Node.js/npm, enables attackers to
  compromise applications by pushing malicious updates to their
  package dependencies. Studying the npm repository, we observed that
  many packages in the npm repository that are used in Node.js
  applications perform only simple computations and do not need access
  to filesystem or network APIs. This offers the opportunity to
  enforce least-privilege design per package, protecting applications
  and package dependencies from malicious updates. We propose a
  lightweight permission system that protects Node.js applications by
  enforcing package permissions at runtime. We discuss the design
  space of solutions and show that our system makes a large number of
  packages much harder to be exploited, almost for free.
