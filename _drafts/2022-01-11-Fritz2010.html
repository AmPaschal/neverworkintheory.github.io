<blockquote class="abstract">
  The size and high rate of change of source code comprising a
  software system make it difficult for software developers to keep up
  with who on the team knows about particular parts of the
  code. Existing approaches to this problem are based solely on
  authorship of code. In this paper, we present data from two
  professional software development teams to show that both authorship
  and interaction information about how a developer interacts with the
  code are important in characterizing a developer's knowledge of
  code. We introduce the degree-of-knowledge model that computes
  automatically a real value for each source code element based on
  both authorship and interaction information. We show that the
  degree-of-knowledge model can provide better results than an
  existing expertise finding approach and also report on case studies
  of the use of the model to support knowledge transfer and to
  identify changes of interest.
