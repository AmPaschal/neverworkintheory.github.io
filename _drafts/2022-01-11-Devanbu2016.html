<blockquote class="abstract">
  Empirical software engineering has produced a steady stream of
  evidence-based results concerning the factors that affect important
  outcomes such as cost, quality, and interval. However, programmers
  often also have strongly-held a priori opinions about these
  issues. These opinions are important, since developers are highly
  trained professionals whose beliefs would doubtless affect their
  practice. As in evidence-based medicine, disseminating empirical
  findings to developers is a key step in ensuring that the findings
  impact practice. In this paper, we describe a case study, on the
  prior beliefs of developers at Microsoft, and the relationship of
  these beliefs to actual empirical data on the projects in which
  these developers work. Our findings are that a) programmers do
  indeed have very strong beliefs on certain topics b) their beliefs
  are primarily formed based on personal experience, rather than on
  findings in empirical research and c) beliefs can vary with each
  project, but do not necessarily correspond with actual evidence in
  that project. Our findings suggest that more effort should be taken
  to disseminate empirical findings to developers and that more
  in-depth study the interplay of belief and evidence in software
  practice is needed.
