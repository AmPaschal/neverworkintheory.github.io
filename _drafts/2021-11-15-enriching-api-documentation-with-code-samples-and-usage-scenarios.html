  <p>
    If you are a programmer, trying to find an Application Programming Interface (API) code sample on StackOverflow to solve a problem won't be a novel activity.
    But why is searching more popular than consulting the official documentations of the APIs?
    definitions, but lacks usage scenarios and a relevant implemented example. <a href="https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/document/8723145">Zhang2021a</a>
    <cite>Zhang2021a</cite> attempts to mitigate this lack by introducing ADECK, an algorithm to provide usage scenario enriched API documentaion by mining crowdsourcing platforms like Stack Overflow.
    like- <em>StackOverflow</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>ADECK</em> mines different API classes from their official documentations, scrapes thrpugh StackOverflow data to filter out <b>Questions</b>(Usage Scenario) and
    <b>Answer</b>(Code-Sample) pairs based on the mined API classes, and then clusters the similar Question-Answer pairs based on use-cases. The algorithm eventually
    builds an enriched API documentation from these clustered "(<em>usage-scenario, code-sample</em>)" pairs. The authors carried out evaluations with human participants
    (<b>graduate students</b>) to mimic real world scenario, and shared their results against an algorithm <em>eXoaDocs</em> with the same objective. Note that <em>ADECK</em> is trying to 
    shift the focus from consulting crowdsource platforms for help to doucmented API use-cases with the help from a crowdsourced platform(<em>StackOverflow</em>). 
    Interesting, isn't it? The findings of the study are:
    <ul>
      <li> Number of <em>ADECK</em>'s code-sample-illustrated API type is much higher than the raw documentation for <em>Java SE</em> and <em>Android AP</em>.</li>
      <li> The code samples collected by ADECK are more concise, correct, and usable than those collected by eXoaDocs. </li>
      <li> WIth graduate students performing, it is shown that <em>ADECK</em> enriched documentation is more productive for developers than the raw and <em>eXoaDoc</em> ones for APIs.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The authors concluded with some threats to their work's validity, and future directions for improving ADECK. This clearly indicates that the approach is only
    the very first step towards the final goal which is quite uncertain given the popularity of the crowdsourced platforms. It is, at this moment of time, unclear 
    how ADECK can be better in popularity than StackOverflow in the future. A evaluation between ADECK's documentation and StackOverflow's Q&As would have given us some 
    kind of notion in that regard.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thus, for a developer or programmer, there is a lot to take from the study. But it is with doubt that using ADECK can start mitigating the use of crowd-sourced
    platforms, and increase using documentations for API usage helps. Although ADECK does not lack promises for the future, for time being it is not ready for the real
    world scenario.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  As one key resource to learn Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs), a lot of API reference documentation lacks code samples with
  usage scenarios, thus heavily hindering developers from programming
  with APIs. Although researchers have investigated how to enrich API
  documentation with code samples from general code search engines,
  two main challenges remain to be resolved, including the quality
  challenge of acquiring high-quality code samples and the mapping
  challenge of matching code samples to usage scenarios. In this
  study, we propose a novel approach named ADECK towards enriching API
  documentation with code samples and corresponding usage scenarios by
  leveraging crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow, a popular technical
  Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) website attracting millions of
  developers. Given an API related Q&amp;A pair, a code sample in the
  answer is extensively evaluated by developers and targeted towards
  resolving the question under the specified usage scenario. Hence,
  ADECK can obtain high-quality code samples and map them to
  corresponding usage scenarios to address the above
  challenges. Extensive experiments on the Java SE and Android API
  documentation show that the number of code-sample-illustrated API
  types in the ADECK-enriched API documentation is 3.35 and 5.76 times
  as many as that in the raw API documentation. Meanwhile, the quality
  of code samples obtained by ADECK is better than that of code
  samples by the baseline approach eXoaDocs in terms of correctness,
  conciseness, and usability, e.g., the average correctness values of
  representative code samples obtained by ADECK and eXoaDocs are 4.26
  and 3.28 on a 5-point scale in the enriched Java SE API
  documentation. In addition, an empirical study investigating the
  impacts of different types of API documentation on the productivity
  of developers shows that, compared against the raw and the
  eXoaDocs-enriched API documentation, the ADECK-enriched API
  documentation can help developers complete 23.81 and 14.29 percent
  more programming tasks and reduce the average completion time by
  9.43 and 11.03 percent.
