<blockquote class="abstract">
  As one key resource to learn Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs), a lot of API reference documentation lacks code samples with
  usage scenarios, thus heavily hindering developers from programming
  with APIs. Although researchers have investigated how to enrich API
  documentation with code samples from general code search engines,
  two main challenges remain to be resolved, including the quality
  challenge of acquiring high-quality code samples and the mapping
  challenge of matching code samples to usage scenarios. In this
  study, we propose a novel approach named ADECK towards enriching API
  documentation with code samples and corresponding usage scenarios by
  leveraging crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow, a popular technical
  Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) website attracting millions of
  developers. Given an API related Q&amp;A pair, a code sample in the
  answer is extensively evaluated by developers and targeted towards
  resolving the question under the specified usage scenario. Hence,
  ADECK can obtain high-quality code samples and map them to
  corresponding usage scenarios to address the above
  challenges. Extensive experiments on the Java SE and Android API
  documentation show that the number of code-sample-illustrated API
  types in the ADECK-enriched API documentation is 3.35 and 5.76 times
  as many as that in the raw API documentation. Meanwhile, the quality
  of code samples obtained by ADECK is better than that of code
  samples by the baseline approach eXoaDocs in terms of correctness,
  conciseness, and usability, e.g., the average correctness values of
  representative code samples obtained by ADECK and eXoaDocs are 4.26
  and 3.28 on a 5-point scale in the enriched Java SE API
  documentation. In addition, an empirical study investigating the
  impacts of different types of API documentation on the productivity
  of developers shows that, compared against the raw and the
  eXoaDocs-enriched API documentation, the ADECK-enriched API
  documentation can help developers complete 23.81 and 14.29 percent
  more programming tasks and reduce the average completion time by
  9.43 and 11.03 percent.
