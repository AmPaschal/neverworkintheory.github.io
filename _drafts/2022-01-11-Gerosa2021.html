<blockquote class="abstract">
  Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the last
  decade, with OSS projects now producing a large ecosystem of popular
  products, involving industry participation, and providing
  professional career opportunities. But our field's understanding of
  what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally
  grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape
  of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also
  evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate
  shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the
  new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals' personal growth as
  they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of
  differences in individuals' demographics. Our results show that some
  motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in
  frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such
  as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly
  relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms
  extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced
  contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward
  career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our
  results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain
  contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support
  the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS
  development.
