<blockquote class="abstract">
  Continuous integration (CI) is a widely used practice in modern
  software engineering. Unfortunately, it is also an expensive
  practice - Google and Mozilla estimate their CI systems in millions
  of dollars. There are a number of techniques and tools designed to
  or having the potential to save the cost of CI or expand its benefit
  - reducing time to feedback. However, their benefits in some
  dimensions may also result in drawbacks in others. They may also be
  beneficial in other scenarios where they are not designed to
  help. In this paper, we perform the first exhaustive comparison of
  techniques to improve CI, evaluating 14 variants of 10 techniques
  using selection and prioritization strategies on build and test
  granularity. We evaluate their strengths and weaknesses with 10
  different cost and time-tofeedback saving metrics on 100 real-world
  projects. We analyze the results of all techniques to understand the
  design decisions that helped different dimensions of benefit. We
  also synthesized those results to lay out a series of
  recommendations for the development of future research techniques to
  advance this area.
