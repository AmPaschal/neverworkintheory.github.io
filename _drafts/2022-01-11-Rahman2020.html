  Software developers attempt to reproduce software bugs to understand
  their erroneous behaviours and to fix them. Unfortunately, they
  often fail to reproduce (or fix) them, which leads to faulty,
  unreliable software systems. However, to date, only a little
  research has been done to better understand what makes the software
  bugs non-reproducible. In this paper, we conduct a multimodal study
  to better understand the non-reproducibility of software
  bugs. First, we perform an empirical study using 576
  non-reproducible bug reports from two popular software systems
  (Firefox, Eclipse) and identify 11 key factors that might lead a
  reported bug to non-reproducibility. Second, we conduct a user study
  involving 13 professional developers where we investigate how the
  developers cope with non-reproducible bugs. We found that they
  either close these bugs or solicit for further information, which
  involves long deliberations and counter-productive manual
  searches. Third, we offer several actionable insights on how to
  avoid non-reproducibility (e.g., false-positive bug report detector)
  and improve reproducibility of the reported bugs (e.g., sandbox for
  bug reproduction) by combining our analyses from multiple studies
  (e.g., empirical study, developer study).
