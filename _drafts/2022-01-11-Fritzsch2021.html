<blockquote class="abstract">
  Technologies play an important role in the hiring process for
  software professionals. Within this process, several studies
  revealed misconceptions and bad practices which lead to suboptimal
  recruitment experiences. In the same context, grey literature
  anecdotally coined the term Résumé-Driven Development (RDD), a
  phenomenon describing the overemphasis of trending technologies in
  both job offerings and resumes as an interaction between employers
  and applicants. While RDD has been sporadically mentioned in books
  and online discussions, there are so far no scientific studies on
  the topic, despite its potential negative consequences. We therefore
  empirically investigated this phenomenon by surveying 591 software
  professionals in both hiring (130) and technical (558) roles and
  identified RDD facets in substantial parts of our sample: 60% of our
  hiring professionals agreed that trends influence their job
  offerings, while 82% of our software professionals believed that
  using trending technologies in their daily work makes them more
  attractive for prospective employers. Grounded in the survey
  results, we conceptualize a theory to frame and explain
  Résumé-Driven Development. Finally, we discuss influencing factors
  and consequences and propose a definition of the term. Our
  contribution provides a foundation for future research and raises
  awareness for a potentially systemic trend that may broadly affect
  the software industry.
