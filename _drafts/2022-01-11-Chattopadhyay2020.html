<blockquote class="abstract">
  Cognitive biases are hard-wired behaviors that influence developer
  actions and can set them on an incorrect course of action,
  necessitating backtracking. While researchers have found that
  cognitive biases occur in development tasks in controlled lab
  studies, we still don't know how these biases affect developers'
  everyday behavior. Without such an understanding, development tools
  and practices remain inadequate. To close this gap, we conducted a
  2-part field study to examine the extent to which cognitive biases
  occur, the consequences of these biases on developer behavior, and
  the practices and tools that developers use to deal with these
  biases. About 70% of observed actions that were reversed were
  associated with at least one cognitive bias. Further, even though
  developers recognized that biases frequently occur, they routinely
  are forced to deal with such issues with ad hoc processes and
  sub-optimal tool support. As one participant (IP12) lamented: There
  is no salvation!
