    Large APIs can be hard to learn, and this can lead to decreased
    programmer productivity. But what makes APIs hard to learn? We
    conducted a mixed approach, multi-phased study of the obstacles
    faced by Microsoft developers learning a wide variety of new
    APIs. The study involved a combination of surveys and in-person
    interviews, and collected the opinions and experiences of over 440
    professional developers. We found that some of the most severe
    obstacles faced by developers learning new APIs pertained to the
    documentation and other learning resources. We report on the
    obstacles developers face when learning new APIs, with a special
    focus on obstacles related to API documentation. Our qualitative
    analysis elicited five important factors to consider when
    designing API documentation: documentation of intent; code
    examples; matching APIs with scenarios; penetrability of the API;
    and format and presentation. We analyzed how these factors can be
    interpreted to prioritize API documentation development efforts.

    Developers don't live on Stack Overflow alone. For many API
    questions, there are still materials and documentation that can
    help them speed up their learning process (or
    there <em>should</em> be, I think, while I try to learn
    node.jsâ€¦). Robillard and DeLine's report is full of rich insights
    and practical implications relevant for anyone trying to improve
    the developer documentation of their products.
