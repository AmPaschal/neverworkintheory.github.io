    Given the increased importance of communication, teamwork, and
    critical thinking skills in the computing profession, we have been
    exploring studio-based instructional methods, in which students
    develop solutions and iteratively refine them through critical
    review by their peers and instructor. We have developed an
    adaptation of studio-based instruction for computing education
    called the pedagogical code review (PCR), which is modeled after
    the code inspection process used in the software
    industry. Unfortunately, PCRs are time-intensive, making them
    difficult to implement within a typical computing course. To
    address this issue, we have developed an online environment that
    allows PCRs to take place asynchronously outside of class. We
    conducted an empirical study that compared a CS 1 course with
    online PCRs against a CS 1 course with face-to-face PCRs. Our
    study had three key results: (a) in the course with face-to-face
    PCRs, student attitudes with respect to self-efficacy and peer
    learning were significantly higher; (b) in the course with
    face-to-face PCRs, students identified more substantive issues in
    their reviews; and (c) in the course with face-to-face PCRs,
    students were generally more positive about the value of PCRs. In
    light of our findings, we recommend specific ways online PCRs can
    be better designed.

    This paper comes from software engineering education rather than software
    engineering per se, but has a lot to say about the latter. Code review is
    now a regular part of most open source projects, thanks in part to online
    code review tools
    like <a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">ReviewBoard</a>. Here, the
    authors compare those kinds of reviews with face-to-face reviews, and find
    that the latter are more effective in several ways: people enjoy them more,
    they find more issues, and they are more likely to come away believing that
    reviews are worth doing.  It would be fascinating to replicate this study
    with both junior programmers joining established teams, and developers with
    more experience who are undertaking reviews systematically for the first
    time.
