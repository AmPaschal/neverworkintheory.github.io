    Spec# is a programming system that facilitates the development of
    correct software. The Spec# language extends C# with contracts
    that allow programmers to express their design intent in the
    code. The Spec# tool suite consists of a compiler that emits
    run-time checks for contracts, a static program verifier that
    attempts to mathematically prove the correctness of programs, and
    an integration into the Visual Studio development
    environment. Spec# shows how contracts and verifiers can be
    integrated seamlessly into the software development process. This
    paper reflects on the six-year history of the Spec# project,
    scientific contributions it has made, remaining challenges for
    tools that seek to establish program correctness, and prospects of
    incorporating verification into everyday software engineering.

    A plethora of testing tools and static analyzers "suddenly" became
    mainstream a decade ago after years of hard work and
    experimentation by their creators.  Today, program verification
    tools are poised to become part of every serious developer's
    toolbox in the same way, not least because of the challenges of
    concurrent programming.  This experience report describes what a
    mature verification tool can do, and what its creators learned
    while building it and trying to persuade people to adopt it.  Even
    if you're not using C#, it offers a lot of insight into things to
    come.
