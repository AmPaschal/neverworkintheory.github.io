    <strong>Context:</strong> Software development depends
    significantly on team performance, as does any process that
    involves human interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Objective:</strong> Most current development methods argue
    that teams should self-manage. Our objective is thus to provide a
    better understanding of the nature of self-managing agile teams,
    and the teamwork challenges that arise when introducing such
    teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Method:</strong> We conducted extensive fieldwork for 9
    months in a software development company that introduced Scrum. We
    focused on the human sensemaking, on how mechanisms of teamwork
    were understood by the people involved.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Results:</strong> We describe a project through Dickinson
    and McIntyre's teamwork model, focusing on the inter-relations
    between essential teamwork components. Problems with team
    orientation, team leadership and coordination in addition to
    highly specialized skills and corresponding division of work were
    important barriers for achieving team effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Transitioning from individual work to
    self-managing teams requires a reorientation not only by
    developers but also by management. This transition takes time and
    resources, but should not be neglected. In addition to Dickinson
    and McIntyre's teamwork components, we found trust and shared
    mental models to be of fundamental importance.

    There are at least two things in this paper that are relevant for
    practice. The first is the fairly detailed account of what went
    right and wrong when this team tried to implement Scrum. The
    second is the emphasis on self-management and its challenges: for
    a lot of people today, Agile means short iterations, daily
    stand-up meetings and unit testing. The self-management aspect
    (the idea that teams should be autonomous, self-regulating, to
    actually have power) is often ignored—which is too bad, because it
    really is at the core of the Agile manifesto and its
    implementations. Moe et al show why this is a problem, and how
    switching to Scrum is more about organizational reorientation than
    about programming practices.
