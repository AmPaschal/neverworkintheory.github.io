    This paper presents data from a four month ethnographic study of
    professional pair programmers from two software development
    teams. Contrary to the current conception of pair programmers, the
    pairs in this study did not hew to the separate roles of "driver "
    and "navigator". Instead, the observed programmers moved together
    through different phases of the task, considering and discussing
    issues at the same strategic "range" or level of abstraction and
    in largely the same role. This form of interaction was reinforced
    by frequent switches in keyboard control during pairing and the
    use of dual keyboards. The distribution of expertise among the
    members of a pair had a strong influence on the tenor of pair
    programming interaction. Keyboard control had a consistent
    secondary effect on decision-making within the pair. These
    findings have implications for software development managers and
    practitioners as well as for the design of software development
    tools.

    The myth of the driver/navigator split in pair programming is very
    pervasive: I've found it in almost all descriptions of pair
    programming I've seen, and in the language that programming pairs
    use to refer to the work that they do. However, Chong and Hurlbutt
    report that, effectively, programming pairs perform the same mixed
    role throughout their collaboration. They also have some
    interesting observations on the effect of keyboard control and
    expertise differentials within the pair.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their suggested implications for pair programming (discussed in
    Section 6):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Move beyond the "driver" and the "navigator".</strong>
      This artificial role distinction only muddles the learning process
      of a new practice.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Help programmers stay focused and engaged.</strong> The
      authors suggest this can be achieved with good hardware support
      (hardware that supports, for instance, fast keyboard switching between
      pairs).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consider differentials in programmer knowledge.</strong>
      Too great a difference is not productive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid pair rotation late in a task.</strong> Re-pair based
      on task completion, not on day cycles.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The latter two suggestions seem commonplace in the firms that I've
    observed that do some pair programming, but I've found that the former
    two still need wider dissemination. What is your experience?
