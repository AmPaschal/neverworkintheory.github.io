    Collaborative development can be hampered when conflicts arise
    because developers have inconsistent copies of a shared
    project. We present an approach to help developers identify and
    resolve conflicts early, before those conflicts become severe and
    before relevant changes fade away in the developers'
    memories. This paper presents three results.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, a study of open-source systems establishes that conflicts
    are frequent, persistent, and appear not only as overlapping
    textual edits but also as subsequent build and test failures. The
    study spans nine open-source systems totaling 3.4 million lines of
    code; our conflict data is derived from 550,000 development
    versions of the systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, using previously-unexploited information, we precisely
    diagnose important classes of conflicts using the novel technique
    of speculative analysis over version control operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third, we describe the design of Crystal, a publicly-available
    tool that uses speculative analysis to make concrete advice
    unobtrusively available to developers, helping them identify,
    manage, and prevent conflicts.

  <p>
    This paper provides a good new look at conflicts in version
    control repositories. Collaboration conflicts appear not just at
    the textual level (which current version control systems can spot
    and often help correct), but also when developers attempt to build
    or test the system. One of the paper's greatest strengths is that
    it shows how pervasive these conflicts are, and that in many cases
    appropriate tooling can help spot them and resolve them more
    efficiently. The authors
    also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crystalvc/">present a
    tool</a> to showcase their conflict detection strategies, which
    seems to be at a better state than most research prototypes, but I
    can't vouch for it as I have not used it.
