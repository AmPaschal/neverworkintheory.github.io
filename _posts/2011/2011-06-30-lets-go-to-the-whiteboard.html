    Software developers are rooted in the written form of their code,
    yet they often draw diagrams representing their
    code. Unfortunately, we still know little about how and why they
    create these diagrams, and so there is little research to inform
    the design of visual tools to support developers' work. This paper
    presents findings from semi-structured interviews that have been
    validated with a structured survey. Results show that most of the
    diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of
    changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings. Diagrams
    that documented design decisions were often externalized in these
    temporary drawings and then subsequently lost. Current
    visualization tools and the software development practices that we
    observed do not solve these issues, but these results suggest
    several directions for future research.

    A lot of people have pointed out that formal diagrammatic
    notations for software, like UML, are taught much more often than
    they're used. This paper goes a long way toward explaining the
    reason: in almost all cases, developers use diagrams as a way of
    keeping track of bits of conversation while talking to each other,
    rather than as archival documentation for the benefit of people
    who weren't there at the time, and the cost of turning the first
    into the second is so great that almost no-one ever does it
    voluntarily.  As well as explaining one aspect of real-world
    software development, this paper is also a great example of how
    qualitative methods can produce answers that quantitative
    investigation never could.
