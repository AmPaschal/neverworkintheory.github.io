    Windows Error Reporting (WER) is a distributed system that
    automates the processing of error reports coming from an installed
    base of a billion machines. WER has collected billions of error
    reports in 10 years of operation. It collects error data
    automatically and classifies errors into buckets, which are used
    to prioritize developer effort and report fixes to users. WER uses
    a progressive approach to data collection, which minimizes
    overhead for most reports yet allows developers to collect
    detailed information when needed. WER takes advantage of its scale
    to use error statistics as a tool in debugging; this allows
    developers to isolate bugs that cannot be found at smaller
    scale. WER has been designed for efficient operation at large
    scale: one pair of database servers records all the errors that
    occur on all Windows computers worldwide.

    Engineering is in part what we do when quantitative differences
    become qualitative differencesâ€”when the ten pounds that we
    can lift easily becomes twenty, then two hundred. This paper is a
    very readable overview of how Microsoft's error reporting team has
    handled such a change in scale. WER's carefully-tuned bucketing
    and aggregation helps developers pinpoint errors and prioritize
    their work, so that the things that will affect the most people
    get the most attention. The authors' discussion of how this works,
    and of the insights that such big data can provide, are a great
    example of how innovative practices can open up new areas of
    research.
