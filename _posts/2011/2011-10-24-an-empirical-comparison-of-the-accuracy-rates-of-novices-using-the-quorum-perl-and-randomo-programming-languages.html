    We present here an empirical study comparing the accuracy rates of
    novices writing software in three programming languages: Quorum,
    Perl, and Randomo. The first language, Quorum, we call an
    evidence-based programming language, where the syntax, semantics,
    and API designs change in correspondence to the latest academic
    research and literature on programming language usability. Second,
    while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language,
    where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator
    and the ASCII table. We compared novices that were programming for
    the first time using each of these languages, testing how
    accurately they could write simple programs using common program
    constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables,
    parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded
    significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and
    Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately
    than those using a language designed by chance.

    In the early 1990s, when I was teaching parallel programming to
    scientists, I discovered very quickly that they found some
    programming systems much easier to learn than others. Data
    parallelism and Linda's tuple spaces? They could get something
    working in half an hour. Message passing? It took hours to get as
    far. When Brent Gorda and I started teaching software engineering
    to scientists a few years later at <a href="http://lanl.gov">Los
    Alamos National Laboratory</a>, we initially used Perl; after
    switching to Python, we found that it only took two days to cover
    material that had previously taken three, and that students seemed
    to remember it better weeks or months later.

    But everyone has stories like that about their favorite
    programming language. Haskell's fans swear that strong typing
    makes all the difference, while fans of Scheme are wont to claim
    that strong typing is for people with weak memories. If anything
    deserves empirical study (if only to put such claims to rest),
    it's this. That's why I enjoyed this paper so much. It isn't just
    their finding that novices using Perl were no more likely to write
    a correct program than novices using a language whose syntax was
    generated randomly (although I did smile quite broadly when I read
    that). This paper's real contribution is to show that such studies
    are possibleâ€”that we can and should put such claims to the
    test, just as Rossbach et al. did
    for <a href="{{'/2011/08/24/is-transactional-programming-actually-easier.html' | relative_url}}">transactional programming</a>.
