    Developer documentation helps developers learn frameworks and
    libraries. To better understand how documentation in open source
    projects is created and maintained, we performed a qualitative
    study in which we interviewed core contributors who wrote
    developer documentation and developers who read documentation. In
    addition, we studied the evolution of 19 documents by analyzing
    more than 1500 document revisions. We identified the decisions
    that contributors make, the factors influencing these decisions
    and the consequences for the project. Among many findings, we
    observed how working on the documentation could improve the code
    quality and how constant interaction with the projects' community
    positively impacted the documentation.

  <p>
    Contributors to a new open source software that are beginning to
    work on its documentation have plenty of choices available to
    them. For instance, they could put their efforts in a public wiki,
    or set a separate documentation team, or just deal with
    documentation piecemeal, as questions for the use of their
    software arise in a forum. These decisions have significant
    consequences for the project later on. Dagenais and Robillard's
    paper is a good description of these important decisions and their
    consequences. I don't think many seasoned open source developers
    will find most results surprising (which is good for this kind of
    paper!), but they'll appreciate having them collected and
    validated empirically.

    Table 3 is the best summary of the paper's findings, if you don't
    have time to read it whole, but it's a bit hard to parse if you
    haven't at least skimmed through the earlier pages.
