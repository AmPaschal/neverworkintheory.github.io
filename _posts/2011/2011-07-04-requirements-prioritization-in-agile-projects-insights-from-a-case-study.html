    Requirements prioritization is an essential mechanism of agile
    software development approaches. It maximizes the value delivered
    to the clients and accommodates changing requirements. This paper
    presents results of an exploratory cross-case study on agile
    prioritization and business value delivery processes in eight
    software organizations. We found that some explicit and
    fundamental assumptions of agile requirement prioritization
    approaches, as described in the agile literature on best
    practices, do not hold in all agile project contexts in our
    study. These are (i) the driving role of the client in the value
    creation process, (ii) the prevailing position of business value
    as a main prioritization criterion, (iii) the role of the
    prioritization process for project goal achievement. This implies
    that these assumptions have to be reframed and that the approaches
    to requirements prioritization for value creation need to be
    extended.

    Mention the phrase "requirements engineering" to many software
    developers and you'll get a groan. For a long time, requirements
    engineering (elicitation, analysis, modeling, etc.) has been seen
    as something you do to satisfy the paper-pushers. There's even a
    derogatory acronym: BRUF, Big Requirements Up Front. Nevertheless,
    the fact remains that we typically build software to satisfy a
    user, even if the user is ourselves. Doing so requires us to think
    about what we should build, and, hopefully, why we are building
    it. While requirements may take different forms (user stories,
    tasks, use cases), they remain fundamental to the process of
    building software.

    This paper points out that the problem of prioritizing
    requirements is even more of a concern in agile methodologies than
    other approaches. This is because short cycle times require
    frequent prioritization of the backlog. To do so, both XP and
    Scrum, for instance, call for an involved customer. However, this
    study found that this was rarely possible, and that as a result
    prioritization was done by the developers. Customers either found
    planning meetings too technical, or were not aware of their own
    requirements. They also found a difference in the understanding of
    the "value" of a requirement: there is a distinct difference
    between the value for the customer and the value for the
    developer. For example, developers might prefer to re-use
    solutions from other projects. Racheva et al. did find, though,
    that the notion of frequent, short iterations with
    re-prioritization was highly useful, in particular for dealing
    with new information and unclear requirements.
