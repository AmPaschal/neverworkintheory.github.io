    Determining the factors that have an influence on software systems
    development and deployment project outcomes has been the focus of
    extensive and ongoing research for more than 30 years. We provide
    here a survey of the research literature that has adressed this
    topic in the period 1996-2006, with a particular focus on
    empirical analyses. On the basis of this survey we present a new
    classification framework that represents an abstracted and
    synthesized view of the types of factors that have been asserted
    as influencing project outcomes.

    Reading this literature review was a strange experience. Despite
    its 56-page length, and the fact that it was published only a
    couple of months ago, it manages to miss most of the interesting
    research in software development of recent years. There seem to be
    two reasons for this. First, the paper focuses almost entirely on
    research coming from the Information Systems community, which for
    reasons I've never understood is fairly disconnected from the
    Software Engineering research community (such as the TSE and ESE
    journals and the ICSE and FSE conferences). Second, the paper only
    considers research published between 1996 and 2006. It took me a
    while to realize this, but most of the exciting developments in
    our field (such as the link between organizational and code
    structure, the exploitation of data mining techniques to predict
    defects, and the rich and detailed qualitative evaluations of
    Agile practices) have only flourished in the last five years or
    so, and therefore would be out of scope for this survey.

    In any case, McLeod and MacDonell's survey provides a long list of
    factors that have been found to affect software projects, along
    with citations for each of them, and in that sense it is a useful
    gateway to research on these topics. Just be aware as you read it
    that, despite its recent publication date, it is fairly dated
    already.
