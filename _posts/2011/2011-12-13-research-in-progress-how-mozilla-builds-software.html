    recently <a href="http://blog.webfwd.org/post/13973466029/code-doesnt-build-software-people-build-software">posted</a>
    a video presentation by UC Berkeley's Prof. Homa Bahrami and her
    student Claire Rudolph, who studied how Mozilla builds software.
    It's full of useful insights about how a distributed mix of
    volunteers and paid professionals builds world-class software
    without drowning in information, and is a great example of
    research in progress.  We'd welcome pointers to more presentations
    of this kind.
