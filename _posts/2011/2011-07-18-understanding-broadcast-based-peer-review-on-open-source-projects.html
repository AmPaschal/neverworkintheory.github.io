    Software peer review has proven to be a successful technique in
    open source software (OSS) development. In contrast to industry,
    where reviews are typically assigned to specific individuals,
    changes are broadcast to hundreds of potentially interested
    stakeholders. Despite concerns that reviews may be ignored, or
    that discussions will deadlock because too many uninformed
    stakeholders are involved, we find that this approach works well
    in practice. In this paper, we describe an empirical study to
    investigate the mechanisms and behaviours that developers use to
    find code changes they are competent to review. We also explore
    how stakeholders interact with one another during the review
    process. We manually examine hundreds of reviews across five high
    profile OSS projects. Our findings provide insights into the
    simple, community-wide techniques that developers use to
    effectively manage large quantities of reviews. The themes that
    emerge from our study are enriched and validated by interviewing
    long-serving core developers.

    Rigby and Storey's report won't surprise people steeped in the
    open source development culture, but everyone else may find it
    instructive. If you are used to assigning code reviews to some of
    your peers, to have other reviews assigned to you, and to only
    work on the items in your queue, the broadcast method of many open
    source projects (that is, broadcast your patch to the mailing list
    and hope it will be picked up, improved, and accepted by others)
    may seem entirely dysfunctional. Still, for the most part it works
    very well, and the authors explain how and why. If you don't have
    time for the full paper, the last section provides a good summary
    of its findings.
