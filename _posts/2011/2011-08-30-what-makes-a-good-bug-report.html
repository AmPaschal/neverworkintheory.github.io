    In software development, bug reports provide crucial information
    to developers. However, these reports widely differ in their
    quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of
    APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug
    report.  The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information
    mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most
    developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test
    cases as helpful, which are at the same time most difficult to
    provide for users. Such insight is helpful for designing new bug
    tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more
    helpful information.  Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and
    measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which
    elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained
    CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as
    part of the survey. In our experiments, CUEZILLA was able to
    predict the quality of 31%--48% of bug reports accurately.

    The information that users supply when they file a bug report
    tends not to be that which the relevant developers need the most,
    and most importantly, it differs in fairly predictable ways and
    for understandable reasons. As Bettenburg et al discuss in their
    paper, this means that efforts at steering users towards providing
    information that is most useful (by telling them how to get it,
    for instance, or by providing a score on the usefulness of the bug
    report as it stands) should yield significant benefits.
