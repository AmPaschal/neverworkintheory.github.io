    Although a number of requirements change classifications have been
    proposed in the literature, there is no empirical assessment of
    their practical value in terms of their capacity to inform change
    monitoring and management. This paper describes an investigation
    of the informative efficacy of a taxonomy of requirements change
    sources which distinguishes between changes arising from 'market',
    'organisation', 'project vision', 'specification' and
    'solution'. This investigation was effected through a case study
    where change data was recorded over a 16 month period covering the
    development lifecycle of a government sector software
    application. While insufficiency of data precluded an
    investigation of changes arising due to the change source of
    'market', for the remainder of the change sources, results
    indicate a significant difference in cost, value to the customer
    and management considerations. Findings show that higher cost and
    value changes arose more often from 'organisation' and 'vision'
    sources; these changes also generally involved the co-operation of
    more stakeholder groups and were considered to be less
    controllable than changes arising from the 'specification' or
    'solution' sources. Overall, the results suggest that monitoring
    and measuring change using this classification is a practical
    means to support change management, understanding and risk
    visibility.

    Many people have considered how best to classify requirements
    changes: for
    example, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=324847">Harker</a>
    (pdf)
    or <a href="http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/2701/2004001825.pdf?sequence=1">Zowghi</a>
    (pdf). In this paper, the authors conducted a single case study to
    understand whether their taxonomy could not only capture the
    various changes which occurred during an industrial software
    development project, but also whether such a classification could
    help with project management concerns.

    It is a well-worn truth that changes in requirements can be very
    expensive to fix later in the project. However, one of the things
    that is typically not considered is the opportunity that a change
    affords. We tend to focus on the negative, but as McGee
    demonstrates during her case study, these changes are a key part
    of business strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, the highest-value/highest-cost changes came from
    the strategic, organization level, and the
    lowest-value/lowest-cost changes to the system from the
    detail-oriented, solution implementation level. The classification
    of change origins provides evidence that the context of the change
    is important in understanding how to manage that change.

    During her research presentation, Sharon McGee also commented on
    the challenges of this type of research. While valuable, the
    organization she embedded with found the research process
    time-consuming. She doubted they would be willing to undergo a
    follow-up study. This is a major barrier to obtaining case study
    opportunities that go beyond the anecdotal.
