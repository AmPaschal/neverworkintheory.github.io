    Mashups are becoming increasingly popular as end users are able to
    easily access, manipulate, and compose data from many web
    sources. We have observed, however, that mashups tend to suffer
    from deficiencies that propagate as mashups are reused. To address
    these deficiencies, we would like to bring some of the benefits of
    software engineering techniques to the end users creating these
    programs. In this work, we focus on identifying code smells
    indicative of the deficiencies we observed in web mashups
    programmed in the popular Yahoo! Pipes environment. Through an
    empirical study, we explore the impact of those smells on end-user
    programmers and observe that users generally prefer mashups
    without smells. We then introduce refactorings targeting those
    smells, reducing the complexity of the mashup programs, increasing
    their abstraction, updating broken data sources and dated
    components, and standardizing their structures to fit the
    community development patterns. Our assessment of a large sample
    of mashups shows that smells are present in 81% of them and that
    the proposed refactorings can reduce the number of smelly mashups
    to 16%, illustrating the potential of refactoring to support the
    thousands of end users programming mashups.

    A great use of computer science-y automation to improve end-user
    programs. In this case the beneficiaries
    are <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>
    users, but the same <em>code smell -&gt; refactor</em> principle
    can easily be used in other web mashups, and eventually in other
    kinds of end-user programs.
