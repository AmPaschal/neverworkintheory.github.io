    Personality tests in various guises are commonly used in
    recruitment and career counseling industries. Such tests have also
    been considered as instruments for predicting the job performance
    of software professionals both individually and in teams. However,
    research suggests that other human-related factors such as
    motivation, general mental ability, expertise, and task complexity
    also affect the performance in general. This paper reports on a
    study of the impact of the Big Five personality traits on the
    performance of pair programmers together with the impact of
    expertise and task complexity. The study involved 196 software
    professionals in three countries forming 98 pairs. The analysis
    consisted of a confirmatory part and an exploratory part. The
    results show that: 1) Our data do not confirm a
    meta-analysis-based model of the impact of certain personality
    traits on performance and 2) personality traits, in general, have
    modest predictive value on pair programming performance compared
    with expertise, task complexity, and country. We conclude that
    more effort should be spent on investigating other
    performance-related predictors such as expertise, and task
    complexity, as well as other promising predictors, such as
    programming skill and learning. We also conclude that effort
    should be spent on elaborating on the effects of personality on
    various measures of collaboration, which, in turn, may be used to
    predict and influence performance. Insights into such malleable,
    rather than static, factors may then be used to improve pair
    programming performance.

    The topic of personality often comes up in discussions of pair
    programming efficiency: whether you need to do an extravert to
    reap its benefits, whether the contrast in personality with your
    peer is important, and so on. Many research studies have addressed
    these questions; Hannay et al is a good place to start reading
    about them. They report: "we found no strong indications that
    personality affects pair programming performance or pair gain in a
    consistent manner", and suggest that industry and research should
    "focus on other predictors of performance, including expertise and
    task complexity" instead, as these factors overshadow any
    personality effects.
