<blockquote><em>Software conflicts arising because of conflicting changes are a regular occurrence and delay projects. The main precept of workspace awareness tools has been to identify potential conflicts early, while changes are still small and easier to resolve. However, in this approach conflicts still occur and require developer time and effort to resolve. We present a novel conflict minimization technique that proactively identifies potential conflicts, encodes them as constraints, and solves the constraint space to recommend a set of conflict-minimal development paths for the team. Here we present a study of four open source projects to characterize the distribution of conflicts 
and their resolution efforts. We then explain our conflict minimization technique and the design and implementation of this technique in our prototype, Cassandra. We show that Cassandra would have successfully avoided a majority of conflicts in the four open source test subjects. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying the technique to a simulated set of scenarios with higher than normal incidence of conflicts.

<p>You've heard it before, "Prevention is better than Cure". For an environment of parallel software development prone to conflicts, authors Kasi and Sarma seek 'prevention' by proactively identifying potential conflicts and minimizing them with Cassandra.
</p>

<p>Cassandra is the implementation of a conflict minimization technique that formalizes a parallel software development context into constraints, and then solves these constraints to determine conflict-minimal development paths for the team.
</p>

<p>A highlight of this paper is the study of four open source projects where the authors found that merge conflicts ranged from 7.6% to 19.3%. Of the clean merges, 2.1% to 14.7% had build failures and 5.6% to 35% of correct builds incurred test failures. Resolving these conflicts took substantial effort, typically spanning multiple days. Kasi and Sarma also found that each project had different distributions of different types of conflicts and different resolution times for each conflict type.
</p>

<p>From these results, the authors concluded that project structures, team policies, and development practices play a role in conflicts and their resolution. Also, that there is no "one-size-fits-all" conflict mitigation technique, instead, analysis need to be fine-tuned per project.
