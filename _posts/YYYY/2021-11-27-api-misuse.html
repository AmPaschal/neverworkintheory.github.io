  <blockquote> 
  
   Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often
  impose constraints such as call order or preconditions. API misuses, i.e., usages violating these constraints, may cause software
  crashes, data-loss, and vulnerabilities. Researchers developed
  several approaches to detect API misuses, typically still resulting
  in low recall and precision. In this work, we investigate ways
  to improve API-misuse detection. We design MUDETECT, an
  API-misuse detector that builds on the strengths of existing
  detectors and tries to mitigate their weaknesses. MUDETECT
  uses a new graph representation of API usages that captures
  different types of API misuses and a systematically designed
  ranking strategy that effectively improves precision. Evaluation
  shows that MUDETECT identifies real-world API misuses with
  twice the recall of previous detectors and 2.5x higher precision. It
  even achieves almost 4x higher precision and recall, when mining
  patterns across projects, rather than from only the target project.

Developers often use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to effortlessly access data, server software or other applications. But misuse of APIs can lead to serious consequences like software crashes, data-loss and what not. Although a lot of API misuse detectors exist in the market, most of them suffer from low precision and recall. 

Fortunately, [SvenAmman2018] have come to the rescue by proposing MUDETECT- an API misuse detector which builds on the strengths and addresses many of the weaknesses of the existing detectors. It outperforms the previous detectors with a 2 times higher recall and 2.5 times higher precision rate. Moreover, it can work in cross project settings and mining patterns across projects, rather than from only the target project.

MUDETECT begins by encoding API usages as API-Usage Graphs (AUGs) to capture properties that can separate misuses from correct usages. It then applies a new detection algorithm to sufficiently mine and identify the violating patterns. It also uses an optimized ranking strategy to effectively rank true positives and thus, improves precision.  

  MUDETECT was evaluated and compared with 4 other API detection tools namely; JADET, GROUMINER, TIKANGA, and DMMC and was found to have out-performed them all with recall of 20.9%, and precision of 21.9% in the typical per-project setting. More impressively, MUDETECTâ€™s recall and precision reached 42.2% and 33.0% in a cross-project setting.
