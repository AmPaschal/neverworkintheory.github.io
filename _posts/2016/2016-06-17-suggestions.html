<p>
  Have you read any empirical software engineering research papers recently
  that you think a wider audience would enjoy?
  If so, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com?subject=NWIT%20paper%20recommendations">send us pointers</a>:
  we'd be happy to feature them.
  (But please note that we only discuss work that is openly available&mdash;nothing paywalled, please.)
