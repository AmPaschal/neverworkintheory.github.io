    The better the software development community becomes at creating software, the
    more software the world seems to demand. Although there is a large body of
    research about measuring and investigating productivity from an organizational
    point of view, there is a paucity of research about how software developers,
    those at the front-line of software construction, think about, assess and try to
    improve their productivity. To investigate software developers' perceptions of
    software development productivity, we conducted two studies: a survey with 379
    professional software developers to help elicit themes and an observational
    study with 11 professional software developers to investigate emergent themes in
    more detail. In both studies, we found that developers perceive their days as
    productive when they complete many or big tasks without significant
    interruptions or context switches. Yet, the observational data we collected
    shows our participants performed significant task and activity switching while
    still feeling productive. We analyze such apparent contradictions in our
    findings and use the analysis to propose ways to better support software
    developers in a retrospection and improvement of their productivity through the
    development of new tools and the sharing of best practices.

  One of the goals of software engineering researchers is to improve
  the productivity of software developers. To show an improvement in
  productivity, you need to be able to measure it, and that turns out
  to be a tricky thing to do.  Researchers have tried metrics such as
  lines of code per day, function points per day and story points per
  iteration, but these are all ultimately unsatisfying. Martin Fowler
  has gone so far as to assert that
  we <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html">cannot
    measure productivity</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, I suspect that every programmer has thought at one time or
  another "I really got nothing today". Similarly, I'd wager that
  every programmer has had days when they simply felt that they were
  more…well, productive.  Like Justice Potter Stewart said of
  pornography, when it comes to productivity, we know it when we see
  it.
</p>

<p>
  And so, it's a shock to discover that this is the first published
  research on software developers' subjective sense of
  productivity. The authors conducted a survey and an observational
  study to understand how productive programmers feel when engaged in
  different tasks, as well as the impact of other factors such as
  having clear goals or switching contexts.
</p>

<p>
  The survey revealed that completing tasks and having few
  interruptions were the top two reasons for a productive workday. The
  surveyed developers selected coding as the most productive
  activity. Developers reported meeting as both the most unproductive
  activity and the second most productive activity, a result that
  manages to be both counter-intuitive and completely unsurprising
  (<a href="http://everythingisobvious.com/">in retrospect</a>).
</p>

<p>
  I personally find observational studies more interesting than
  surveys, and this paper is no exception. For example, I would not
  have guessed that developers spend only 3.9% of their time debugging
  compared to 32.3% of their time coding.  I was also surprised by the
  high rate of activity switching the authors observed: 47 times per
  hour(!).
</p>

<p>
  The challenge in this kind of observational research is applying the
  results.  The authors do make some suggestions about ways this
  information could be used to improve productivity (e.g., monitoring
  tools, reducing context switching, setting goals), but these aren't
  nearly as interesting as the results themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Still, even if we don't quite know what to do with this information
  yet, the results are still important to help us to better understand
  how software developers perceive their own productivity.
