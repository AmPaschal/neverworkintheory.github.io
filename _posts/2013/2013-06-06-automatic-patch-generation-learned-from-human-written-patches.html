    Patch generation is an essential software maintenance task because
    most software systems inevitably have bugs that need to be
    fixed. Unfortunately, human resources are often insufficient to
    fix all reported and known bugs. To address this issue, several
    automated patch generation techniques have been proposed. In
    particular, a genetic-programming-based patch generation
    technique, GenProg, proposed by Weimer et al., has shown promising
    results. However, these techniques can generate nonsensical
    patches due to the randomness of their mutation operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    To address this limitation, we propose a novel patch generation
    approach, Pattern-based Automatic program Repair (PAR), using fix
    patterns learned from existing human-written patches. We manually
    inspected more than 60,000 human-written patches and found there
    are several common fix patterns. Our approach leverages these fix
    patterns to generate program patches automatically. We
    experimentally evaluated PAR on 119 real bugs. In addition, a user
    study involving 89 students and 164 developers confirmed that
    patches generated by our approach are more acceptable than those
    generated by GenProg. PAR successfully generated patches for 27
    out of 119 bugs, while GenProg was successful for only 16 bugs.

    Software products are released with known and unknown bugs. For
    example, this paper by Kim et al. mentions that Windows 2000 was
    released with over 60K known bugs. Why? Bug repairs are for the
    most part done manually and there are not enough resources to
    repair all of them. Automatic patch generation methods have been
    devise to reduce this manual effort.

    To add to this field of research, Kim et al. integrate the human
    element with machine learning. They do this by manually reviewing
    human written patches to create fix-pattern templates used to then
    generate "candidate" patches. The purpose in doing this was to
    solve the issue of what they consider to be "nonsensical patches"
    produced by GenProg
    (<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-icse2012-genprog-preprint.pdf">https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-icse2012-genprog-preprint.pdf</a>). GenProg's
    approach to automated patch generation is based on genetic
    programming used to search the vast space of possible program
    repairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two interesting aspects of the Kim et al. paper are that the
    patches generated from one project are used successfully on other
    projects and the fix-pattern templates once created can be use
    repeatedly. However, one element not measured in this paper is the
    monetary cost of fixing each bug (measured in GenProg),
    considering the bounties offered for bug fixes by some companies,
    it would be interesting to see such a result included in future
    automatic patch generation methods.
