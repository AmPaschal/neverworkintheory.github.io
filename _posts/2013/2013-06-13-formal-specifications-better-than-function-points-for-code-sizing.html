    Size and effort estimation is a significant challenge for the
    management of large-scale formal verification projects. We report
    on an initial study of relationships between the sizes of
    artefacts from the development of seL4, a formally-verified
    embedded systems microkernel. For each API function we first
    determined its COSMIC Function Point (CFP) count (based on the
    seL4 user manual), then sliced the formal specifications and
    source code, and performed a normalised line count on these
    artefact slices. We found strong and significant relationships
    between the sizes of the artefact slices, but no significant
    relationships between them and the CFP counts. Our finding that
    CFP is poorly correlated with lines of code is based on just one
    system, but is largely consistent with prior literature. We find
    CFP is also poorly correlated with the size of formal
    specifications. Nonetheless, lines of formal specification
    correlate with lines of source code, and this may provide a basis
    for size prediction in future formal verification projects. In
    future work we will investigate proof sizing.

    Donald Knuth reportedly once said that C was the best language
    ever invented for analyzing algorithms because you could see how
    many atomic operations there were simply by counting
    punctuation. In this paper, Staples et al. apply that idea at a
    much, much higher level. Does the size of the formal specification
    for part of a micro-kernel correlate with the number of lines
    required to implement it? The answer appears to be "yes", and
    moreover, that correlation is much better than the correlation
    between lines of code and function points. This doesn't
    necessarily mean that formal specifications are worth writing
    solely as an aid to project cost estimation, but it does open up
    some new practical applicationsâ€”not least, the question of
    whether the effort saved by having a formal specification repays
    the cost of creating it. We look forward to seeing this work
    replicated on other systems.
