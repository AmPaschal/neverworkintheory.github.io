    Access control models implement mechanisms to restrict access to
    sensitive data from unprivileged users. Access controls typically
    check privileges that capture the semantics of the operations they
    protect. Semantic smells and errors in access control models stem
    from privileges that are partially or totally unrelated to the
    action they protect.

  <p>
    This paper presents a novel approach, partly based on static
    analysis and information retrieval techniques, for the automatic
    detection of semantic smells and errors in access control
    models. Investigation of the case study application revealed 31
    smells and 2 errors. Errors were reported to developers who
    quickly confirmed their relevance and took actions to correct
    them. Based on the obtained results, we also propose three
    categories of semantic smells and errors to lay the foundations
    for further research on access control smells in other systems and
    domains.

    Perfection can be boring and time consuming. Anyone trying to make
    a living building perfect software will (maybe) die a pauper. But
    are there some areas where we must seek perfection? Privacy and
    security come to mind and the story
    of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330884">Firefox
    Bug 330884</a> which starts as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This privacy flaw has caused my fiancé and I to break-up after
      having dated for 5 years.
    </p>

    In their work on semantic smells and errors, Gauthier and Merlo
    focus on access control models for web applications (many of which
    now deal with private and security sensitive
    information). Semantic smell is seen as the situation where the
    semantic of the privilege does not always clearly relate to the
    semantic of the protected action. For example when the semantic
    relationship is only partial it gives rise to semantic
    smells. Semantic errors occurs in the absence of that relationship
    and this must be fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this work, the authors make the assumption that, "…semantically
    related sections of source code usually perform similar actions
    and should therefore be protected by similar privileges". If not,
    they assume that there might be semantic smells and errors. To
    test this assumption they used automated methods to first map
    privileges to source code, then extract semantically related
    sections of code. Finally, using logistic regression to create a
    privilege prediction model, they were able to infer the privileges
    that should protect a block of code.
  </p>

    Gauthier and Merlo's results are promising. From their case study,
    they found 31 semantic smells and two semantic errors. But what is
    most significant about the result is that when the authors
    submitted bug reports for the semantic errors as potential
    security issues, they were accepted within two days by developers.
