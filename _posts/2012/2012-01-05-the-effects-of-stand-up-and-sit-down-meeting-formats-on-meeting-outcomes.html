    The effects of meeting format (standing or sitting) on meeting
    length and the quality of group decision making were investigated
    by comparing meeting outcomes for 56 five-member groups that
    conducted meetings in a standing format with 55 five-member groups
    that conducted meetings in a seated format. Sit-down meetings were
    34% longer than stand-up meetings, but they produced no better
    decisions than stand-up meetings. Significant differences were
    also obtained for satisfaction with the meeting and task
    information use during the meeting but not for synergy or
    commitment to the group's decision. The findings were generally
    congruent with meeting-management recommendations in the
    time-management literature, although the lack of a significant
    difference for decision quality was contrary to theoretical
    expectations. This contrary finding may have been due to
    differences between the temporal context in which this study was
    conducted and those in which other time constraint research has
    been conducted, thereby revealing a potentially important
    contingency—temporal context.

    If there's one practice that caught on with every software team
    that calls itself Agile, it's got to be daily stand-up
    meetings. If you hold your meetings standing up, the argument
    goes, they will go briskly, which is great because nobody likes
    meetings that drag on and on, especially if you hold them
    daily. This paper provides valuable evidence with respect to the
    efficacy of stand-up meetings: they are significantly shorter than
    sit-down meetings, and the decisions taken in them are just as
    good. Their only downside in the experiment is that participants
    were less satisfied with the meeting than those in sit-down
    meetings.

    These were all 5-person meetings lasting 10-20 minutes and
    concerning a well-defined problem. The authors warn:
    "…additional research is needed to determine whether the
    stand-up meeting can be used for longer meetings dealing with
    problems that vary in their structure."

    (Thanks to Laurent Bossavit for pointing me to this paper. If you
    know of interesting papers that are relevant for software
    practitioners, even—or especially—if they're from other
    disciplines, please send them our way! Also, note that we try to
    post links to freely downloadable versions of the papers we
    discuss. Sometimes, as in this case, we found none—but e-mailing
    the authors and asking nicely usually gets you a copy.)
