    The adoption of distributed version control (DVC), such as Git and
    Mercurial, in open-source software (OSS) projects has been
    explosive. Why is this and how are projects using DVC? This new
    generation of version control supports two important new
    features: <em>distributed repositories</em>,
    and <em>history-preserving branching and merging</em> where
    branching is easier, faster, and more accurately recorded. We
    observe that the vast majority of projects using DVC continue to
    use a centralized model of code sharing, while using branching
    much more extensively than when using CVC. In this study, we
    examine how branches are used by over sixty projects adopting DVC
    in an effort to understand and evaluate how branches are used and
    what benefits they provide. Through interviews with lead
    developers in OSS projects and a quantitative analysis of mined
    data from development histories, we find that projects that have
    made the transition are using observable branches more heavily to
    enable natural collaborative processes: history-preserving
    branching allow developers to collaborate on tasks in highly
    cohesive branches, while enjoying <em>reduced interference</em>
    from developers working on other tasks, even if those tasks
    are <em>strongly coupled</em> to theirs.

    As the authors observe, distributed version control has become a
    must-have for fashionable open source developers in the past four
    years. But is it actually more productive than traditional
    (centralized) version control? Is it actually
    even <em>different</em>, once the hype is cleared away? According
    to this new study by Barr et al, the answer is a qualified "yes":
    while most projects (and developers) still use a hub-and-spoke
    model in practice, they make heavy use of DVCSes' support for
    lightweight branching and merging. Knowing this may help designers
    of the next generation of version control systems find better ways
    to support what people actually do.
