    Large organizations like Microsoft tend to rely on formal
    requirements documentation in order to specify and design the
    software products that they develop. These documents are meant to
    be tightly coupled with the actual implementation of the features
    they describe. In this paper we evaluate the value of high-level
    topic-based requirements traceability in the version control
    system, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We evaluate LDA
    topics on practitioners and check if the topics and trends
    extracted matches the perception that Program Managers and
    Developers have about the effort put into addressing certain
    topics. We found that effort extracted from version control that
    was relevant to a topic often matched the perception of the
    managers and developers of what occurred at the time. Furthermore
    we found evidence that many of the identified topics made sense to
    practitioners and matched their perception of what occurred. But
    for some topics, we found that practitioners had difficulty
    interpreting and labelling them. In summary, we investigate the
    high-level traceability of requirements topics to version control
    commits via topic analysis and validate with the actual
    stakeholders the relevance of these topics extracted from
    requirements.

    A holy grail of software research is to (automatically) relate the
    business value of the software feature to the code implementing
    that feature, known
    as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability"><em>requirements
    traceability</em></a>. All sorts of benefits are posited to result
    from this, including the ability to tell whether your customer's
    needs are met.
  </p>
  <p>
    One approach to this is to use an information retrieval technique
    called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic
    modelling</a>. Topic modelling generates word distributions for a
    set of documents, like requirements specifications. One of the
    problems with topic modelling is that the topics are presented as
    lists of seemingly unrelated words, and the content of these
    topics must be captured with a descriptive label. In this paper
    the authors assess whether developers at Microsoft find the topics
    easy to label and understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    What they discovered was that the study participants agreed with
    the proposed linkages between requirements topics and commits, but
    that the topics were difficult to label without being customized
    to the individual developer. Program managers seemed to find the
    topics more comprehensible, possibly because they deal with a
    wider array of features in their work. Further use of topic
    modelling in this area seems to require labelling by domain
    experts before being widely applicable to the traceability
    problem.
