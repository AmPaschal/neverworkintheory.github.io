    Software often crashes. Once a crash happens, a crash report could
    be sent to software developers for investigation upon user
    permission. To facilitate efficient handling of crashes, crash
    reports received by Microsoft's Windows Error Reporting (WER)
    system are organized into a set of "buckets". Each bucket contains
    duplicate crash reports that are deemed as manifestations of the
    same bug. The bucket information is important for prioritizing
    efforts to resolve crashing bugs. To improve the accuracy of
    bucketing, we propose ReBucket, a method for clustering crash
    reports based on call stack matching. ReBucket measures the
    similarities of call stacks in crash reports and then assigns the
    reports to appropriate buckets based on the similarity values. We
    evaluate ReBucket using crash data collected from five widely-used
    Microsoft products. The results show that ReBucket achieves better
    overall performance than the existing methods. On average, the
    F-measure obtained by ReBucket is about 0.88.

    For successful software products, one nasty consequence of a
    massive user base is the similarly massive amount of crash reports
    that they produce. Somebody (or some tool) needs to sift through
    all of them and categorize them to figure out if there's anything
    that's new and worthy of investigation, as well as which bugs are
    in most urgent need of attention. Dang et al developed a method to
    cluster these crash reports (the paper describes it in some
    detail), and it seems to have pretty good results so farâ€”and
    although it has been tried only on Microsoft data, the authors are
    planning to move onto other projects as well.
