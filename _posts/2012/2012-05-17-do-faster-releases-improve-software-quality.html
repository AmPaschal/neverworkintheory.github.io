    Nowadays, many software companies are shifting from the
    traditional 18-month release cycle to shorter release cycles. For
    example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions
    every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users'
    waiting time for a new release and offer better marketing
    opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of
    the software product improves as well, since shorter release
    cycles result in shorter testing periods. In this paper, we
    empirically study the development process of Mozilla Firefox in
    2010 and 2011, a period during which the project transitioned to a
    shorter release cycle. We compare crash rates, median uptime, and
    the proportion of post-release bugs of the versions that had a
    shorter release cycle with those having a traditional release
    cycle, to assess the relation between release cycle length and the
    software quality observed by the end user. We found that (1) with
    shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more
    post-release bugs and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users
    experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the
    program crashes earlier).

    Designing and building software is not like assembly-line
    manufacturing, but some aspects of it <em>can</em> be studied and
    improved like other industrial processes. In this upcoming paper,
    Khomh et al. examine the effects of Mozilla's switch from a yearly
    (or longer) release cycle to a much more frequent cycle. Their raw
    material is bug and crash data; their conclusions are:
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Users experience crashes earlier during the execution of versions developed following a rapid release model.</li>
  <li>The Firefox rapid release model fixes bugs faster than using the traditional model, but fixes proportionally less bugs.</li>
  <li>With a rapid release model, users adopt new versions faster compared to the traditional release model.</li>
</ol>
  <p>
    #3 is good news; #2 is (mostly) good, but #1 is a puzzle for which
    the authors don't have an explanationâ€”at least, not
    yet. We'd welcome suggestions about why it might be.
