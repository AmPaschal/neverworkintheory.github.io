    Despite its vast capacity and associative powers, the human brain
    does not deal well with interruptions. Particularly in situations
    where information density is high, such as during a programming
    task, recovering from an interruption requires extensive time and
    effort. Although modern program development environments have
    begun to recognize this problem, none of these tools take into
    account the brain's structure and limitations. In this paper, we
    present a conceptual framework for understanding human memory
    organization and its strengths and weaknesses, particularly with
    respect to dealing with work interruptions. The framework explains
    empirical results obtained from experiments in which programmers
    were interrupted. The intent is to use the framework to design
    development tools capable of compensating for human memory
    limitations. We also delineate programmer information needs such
    tools must satisfy and suggest several memory aids such tools
    could provide.

    Parnin and Rugaber discuss several cognitive challenges that
    probably every developer has faced at some point: tracking many
    code locations at once while doing a big refactoring, or trying to
    remind ourselves to continue work on a certain problem when an
    external event has occurred. For these challenges, they give
    examples for coping strategies that, again, probably every
    programmer has used one time or the other. We send reminder
    e-mails to ourselves, add <code>// TODO</code> comments that we
    forget about later, or deliberately create compiler errors as an
    anchor into our current task.
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors analyze and classify these challenges and coping
    strategies using existing research from neuroscience. The result
    is a theoretical framework that is mostly interesting to
    researchers and a few practitioners who wish to create better
    developer tools. Wearing my researcher hat, I cannot help but to
    instantly try thinking of neat ways to leverage this framework as
    a designing aid for developer support mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when I put on my developer hat, I realize that it's even
    more than that. Parnin's and Rugaber's framework helps me reflect
    upon my own programming habits and provides some explanations for
    their existence. For example, why is it that so
    many <code>TODO</code>s remain in code for so long, never to
    be <code>DONE</code>? They are passive reminders that are never
    triggered!
  </p>
  <p>
    Even without the tool support that Parnin and Rugaber are
    creating, their paper provides an interesting look at ourselves as
    developers, our habits, our weaknesses, and our coping
    strategies. In doing so, it raises our awareness for these issues
    and inspires us to slight modifications of our work practices that
    are better tailored to our human brains. The next time I write
    a <code>TODO</code>, I'll make sure to create an automatic
    reminder as well.
