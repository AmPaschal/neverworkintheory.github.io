    The cognitive dimensions framework is a broad-brush evaluation
    technique for interactive devices and for non-interactive
    notations. It sets out a small vocabulary of terms designed to
    capture the cognitively-relevant aspects of structure, and shows
    how they can be traded off against each other. The purpose of this
    paper is to propose the framework as an evaluation technique for
    visual programming environments. We apply it to two
    commercially-available dataflow languages (with further examples
    from other systems) and conclude that it is effective and
    insightful; other HCI-based evaluation techniques focus on
    different aspects and would make good complements. Insofar as the
    examples we used are representative, current VPLs are successful
    in achieving a good 'closeness of match', but designers need to
    consider the 'viscosity' (resistance to local change) and the
    'secondary notation' (possibility of conveying extra meaning by
    choice of layout, colour, etc.).

    It must be a major coup as a researcher for your research to make
    in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions_of_notations">onto
    Wikipedia</a> (and not get deleted for "notability"). The reason
    the Cognitive Dimensions framework has had such impact is that it
    is a great way to assess user interfaces without conducting user
    studies (which are costly and often of questionable
    value). Green's Cognitive Dimensions framework proposes a set of
    heuristic criteria which evaluate how well the interface supports
    certain tasks. These criteria
    include <em>consistency</em>, <em>hard mental operations</em>
    and <em>error-proneness</em>.

    In this paper Green and Petre apply the framework to visual
    programming environments
    (e.g., <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/">Simulink</a>). The
    research question they investigate is the degree to which these
    tools help in writing software compared to a text editor for Basic
    programming, using a yardstick problem of calculating rocket
    trajectory.

    Some of their findings:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Visual programming languages can easily grow incomprehensible, placing "severe demands on working memory" as concepts become intertwined.</li>
  <li>Abstraction is easier to manage in visual languages, since low-level items can literally be hidden away.</li>
  <li>Adding new code to existing visual programs was very slow: from 508 seconds for LabView, 194 seconds for Prograph and only 63 seconds in Basic, which they note is "an astonishing ratio of 8:1 between extremes".</li>
  <li>These languages, like spreadsheets, make long-range data dependencies difficult to track down.</li>
  <li>Textual languages (like Pascal or Basic) support secondary notations such as the use of whitespace or statement ordering to communicate other information. In the two visual languages they studied, these notations are meagre. Visual layout is not terribly useful for communicating information. For example, "I quite often spend an hour or two just moving boxes and wires around, with no change in functionality, to make it that much more comprehensible when I come back to it."
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>
    Many of these findings are even more relevant today in the
    model-driven design (MDD) field, and show the power of a simple
    set of heuristics in uncovering potential difficulties. Designers
    of modern visual language tools
    (like <a href="http://www.metacase.com/mwb/">Metacase</a>) should
    be able to explain how they overcome these challenges.
