    Every method for developing software is a prescriptive
    model. Applying a deconstructionist analysis to methods reveals
    that there are two texts, or sets of assumptions and ideals: a set
    that is privileged by the method and a second set that is left
    out, or marginalized by the method. We apply this analytical lens
    to software reuse, a technique in software development that seeks
    to expedite one's own project by using programming artifacts
    created by others. By analyzing the methods prescribed by
    Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE), we arrive at two
    texts: Methodical CBSE and Amethodical Remixing. Empirical data
    from four studies on code search on the web draws attention to
    four key points of tension: status of component boundaries;
    provenance of source code; planning and process; and evaluation
    criteria for candidate code. We conclude the paper with a
    discussion of the implications of this work for the limits of
    methods, structure of organizations that reuse software, and the
    design of search engines for source code.

    One of the ways in which the Internet transformed software
    development is the prevalence of the "programming by Google"
    practice: searching online for a function or snippet that does
    what you want, and copy-and-pasting it into one's own code,
    stitching it as needed to make it work. This practice is great in
    some ways (it speeds up development, it helps cross-pollinate
    ideas and techniques), but it also has its problems (maintaining
    code provenance, intellectual property, and diverging from policy,
    for example).

    In this paper, Sim et al provide a very good exploration of the
    distinction between the safer, more planned, and stuffier
    "component reuse" approach and the ad-hoc, versatile,
    under-the-table "snippet remixing" approach to code reuse. They
    have some interesting statistics on the use of both approaches
    (for instance: 92% of surveyed developers admit to remixing
    snippets of code), and they identify points of tension between
    them. Their paper should be a wake-up call for Software
    Engineering professors to stop acting as if component-based reuse
    was all there is to code reuse, and an invitation to practitioners
    to consider the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and to
    define the right balance between them in their own contexts.

    graduate advisor, though we did not overlap. Also, here is one
    more reminder that we link to PDFs of the papers we discuss when
    we find them. In cases we do not, asking the authors nicely for a
    copy usually works.)</em>
