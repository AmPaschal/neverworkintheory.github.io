    Using code examples in professional software development is like teenage
    sex. Those who say they do it all the time are probably lying. Although it
    is natural, those who do it feel guilty. Finally, once they start doing it,
    they are often not too concerned with safety, they discover that it is going
    to take a while to get really good at it, and they realize they will have to
    come up with a bunch of new ways of doing it before they really figure it
    all out.

  <p>
    After we had an interesting discussion with input from industry a
    few weeks ago with the
    paper <a href="{{'/2012/04/10/component-reuse-vs-snippet-remixing.html' | relative_url}}">"Component
    reuse vs. snippet remixing"</a>, I want to follow-up in that
    direction with another perspective. Apart from the hilarious
    abstract, it is a paper that reads well and entertains. In
    addition, it sheds some light onto a common, yet shunned practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    From time to time, developers use example code from the Web in
    their own code. In his essay, Barzilay lays the foundation for
    talking about this phenomenon and identifies the elements of that
    ecosystem. For example, he mentions what kinds of sites are used
    by developers and what the process of reusing an example can look
    like. Addressing concerns from the <em>Component reuse vs. snippet
    remixing</em> paper, he discusses potential solutions for making
    the practice safer and more systematic. Finally, as an interesting
    analogy, Barzilay contrasts example embedding with academic
    practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the use of examples from the Web may be looked down upon by
    several developers, it is a pervasive practice. Yet, neither
    industry nor research provide comprehensive support for making it
    safer. Barzilay's essay helps us understand what the example
    ecosystem looks like and gives us ideas for possible solutions of
    its problems.
