    Software development effort estimates are frequently too low,
    which may lead to poor project plans and project failures. One
    reason for this bias seems to be that the effort estimates
    produced by software developers are affected by information that
    has no relevance for the actual use of effort. We attempted to
    acquire a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and
    the robustness of this type of estimation bias. For this purpose,
    we hired 374 software developers working in outsourcing companies
    to participate in a set of three experiments. The experiments
    examined the connection between estimation bias and developer
    dimensions: self-construal (how one sees oneself), thinking style,
    nationality, experience, skill, education, sex, and organizational
    role. We found that estimation bias was present along most of the
    studied dimensions. The most interesting finding may be that the
    estimation bias increased significantly with higher levels of
    interdependence, i.e., with stronger emphasis on connectedness,
    social context, and relationships. We propose that this connection
    may be enabled by an activation of one's self-construal when
    engaging in effort estimation, and a connection between a more
    interdependent self-construal and increased search for indirect
    messages, lower ability to ignore irrelevant context, and a
    stronger emphasis on socially desirable responses.

    Researchers know that estimates of software development effort can
    be biased pretty easily by anchors and by irrelevant
    information. An important question, though, is whether these
    biases occur due to purely cognitive reasons or due to a desire to
    please and to connect with others. J&oslash;rgensen and Grimstad
    help answer this question, by getting hundreds of paid developers
    from several countries to participate in an experiment. Some of
    their findings:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Bias in effort estimation seems to be present for developers
      from all the countries studied. We were unable to find strong
      and systematic differences between countries or regions (Eastern
      Europe and Asia). (…)
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the lack of any strong and systematic difference
      between the countries and regions, there may be culturally
      related variables that are useful for understanding the
      mechanisms by which estimation biases occur. In particular, a
      developer's level of interdependence (emphasis on connectedness,
      social context, and relationship) seems to be connected
      systematically with how much he or she was affected by
      irrelevant and misleading information and with lower effort
      estimates.
    </p>

    In other words, they found that everyone (that would
    include <em>you</em> and your peers) seems susceptible to
    estimation biases, that people with greater levels of
    "interdependence" (those that give greater weight to relationships
    and connectedness) are more subject to bias, and that despite
    this, cultural differences by country do not seem to play an
    important role in estimation bias. The best thing you can do, in
    any case, is to try to shield estimators from anchors and other
    sources of bias as much as possible.
