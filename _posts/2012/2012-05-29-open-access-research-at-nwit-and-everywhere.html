  <p>
    We interrupt our regular programming to let you know of a slight change in
    editorial policy: although we always try to present journal and conference
    papers that are freely accessible online, we've made exceptions for
    interesting research that is only available behind a paywall. But our goal
    is to build bridges between software research and practice, and paywalled
    papers do not help—especially when considering that they report on research
    that, more often than not, citizens already paid for with their
    taxes. Therefore, from now on, <em>open access</em> is one of our few basic
    requirements for discussing papers at NWIT—the others being <em>empirical
    findings</em>, <em>relevance to practitioners</em>, and <em>no
    self-promotion</em>.
  </p>

<p>
  To clarify: at this point we don't care if the papers we present are
  available to the public through an Open Access journal (there's
  still <a href="http://zephoria.tumblr.com/post/1054392618/open-access-journals">few
  of those in our area</a>) or through a researcher's personal
  website, as long as you can access them for free.

  Open Access is gathering steam right now, and for good
  reason: <a title="Monbiot on academic publishing"
  href="http://www.monbiot.com/2011/08/29/the-lairds-of-learning/">academic
  publishing is one of the most abusive and least necessary businesses
  around</a>. Currently, <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/sign-the-white-house-petition-on-open-access-to-research-today">in
  the United States</a>, there is <a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/#!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ">an
  online petition at the White House website</a> to require free
  access over the Internet to scientific articles arising from
  taxpayer-funded research. If enough people sign the petition, the
  White House is bound to consider it. It's currently about 6,000
  signatures below the threshold; if this is something you care for at
  all, please consider adding your name today.
