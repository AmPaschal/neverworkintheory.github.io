    <strong>Background:</strong> Despite decades of research, there is
    no consensus on which software effort estimation methods produce
    the most accurate models.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Aim:</strong> Prior work has reported that, given M
    estimation methods, no single method consistently outperforms all
    others. Perhaps rather than recommending one estimation method as
    best, it is wiser to generate estimates from ensembles of multiple
    estimation methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Method:</strong> 9 learners were combined with 10
    pre-processing options to generate 9 &times; 10 = 90
    solo-methods. These were applied to 20 data sets and evaluated
    using 7 error measures. This identified the best n (in our case n
    = 13) solo-methods that showed stable performance across multiple
    datasets and error measures. The top 2, 4, 8 and 13 solo-methods
    were then combined to generate 12 multi-methods, which were then
    compared to the solo-methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Results:</strong> (i) The top 10 (out of 12) multi-methods
    significantly out-performed all 90 solo-methods. (ii) The error
    rates of the multi-methods were significantly less than the
    solo-methods. (iii) The ranking of the best multi-method was
    remarkably stable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> While there is no best single effort
    estimation method, there exist best combinations of such effort
    estimation methods.

    Anybody who has ever done software effort estimation knows that
    it's a pretty hard thing to do. It's tough even for small
    individual tasks for someone without practice, and it's a horribly
    difficult task for large-scale group projects even for estimators
    with lots of practice. There are many methods that estimators
    could use, but as Kocaguneli &amp; Co remind us, "no single method
    consistently outperforms all others"â€”sometimes you're better off
    using method A, other times, method B would've been more
    appropriate. Their proposal: to build ensembles of methods, each
    of them deficient on their own, and to plug them with different
    automated learners in the hope that these new multi-methods will
    provide estimates with less error and more consistency.
  </p>
  <p>
    The multi-methods approach worked well in their (pretty large)
    dataset of nearly 1,200 projects. This does <em>not</em> mean that
    the method that came out on top for them will come out on top for
    you, too. It only means that ensembles of methods are a good
    workaround for the problem of inconsistency of method
    efficacy. What the authors propose is for practitioners to learn
    the basics of machine learning and build method ensembles
    themselves:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Therefore, our recommendations to practitioners, who are willing
      to use multi-methods but lack the knowledge of machine learning
      algorithms are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with initial 2 learners and build the associated multi-methods</li>
      <li>See the performance of the current multi-methods</li>
      <li>Build new multi-methods only if you are not pleased with the performance of the current ones</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    That won't be an easy task, but it may be less painful than
    committing to using a single method that often won't work. If
    you're interested in doing it, this paper has several references
    and pointers to get you started.
