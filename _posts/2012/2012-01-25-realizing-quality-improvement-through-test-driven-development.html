    Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice
    that has been used sporadically for decades. With this practice, a
    software engineer cycles minute-by-minute between writing failing
    unit tests and writing implementation code to pass those
    tests. Test- driven development has recently re-emerged as a
    critical enabling practice of agile software development
    methodologies. However, little empirical evidence supports or
    refutes the utility of this practice in an industrial
    context. Case studies were conducted with three development teams
    at Microsoft and one at IBM that have adopted TDD. The results of
    the case studies indicate that the pre-release defect density of
    the four products decreased between 40% and 90% relative to
    similar projects that did not use the TDD practice. Subjectively,
    the teams experienced a 15&ndash;35% increase in initial
    development time after adopting TDD.

  <p>
    In the test-driven development (TDD) chapter
    of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596808303.do"><em>Making
    Software</em></a>, Turhan et al reported that the evidence for it
    is mixed: there is moderate support for the claim that it improves
    quality, and it is not quite clear if this entails a productivity
    cost. To come up with this conclusion, the authors went through
    all the papers they could find on the topicâ€”some of them reporting
    experiments with students, some with practitioners, and with
    highly varying quality.</p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, one of the stronger papers in their sample was this
    one, by Nagappan et al. It reports on four teams, one at IBM
    and three at Microsoft, and it contrasts TDD vs. comparable
    non-TDD teams post-hoc (so the study did not bias data
    collection). As the abstract points out, there were far fewer
    defects in all four products, though managers at all teams
    reported an increase in development time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conservatism in the <em>Making Software</em> chapter is
    warranted: there is still conflicting empirical evidence with TDD,
    as with most other practices in software development. But studies
    like Nagappan et al's show that TDD is likely to be
    beneficial. Just note that (at least in the Microsoft teams they
    studied) "there was no enforcement and monitoring of the TDD
    practice; and decisions to use TDD were made as a group." In other
    words, developers applied TDD because they wanted to, not because
    of a decree from their manager. Whether it would've been as
    effective otherwise is an open question.
