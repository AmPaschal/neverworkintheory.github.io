    Traditionally, many types of software documentation, such as API
    documentation, require a process where a few people write for many
    potential users. The resulting documentation, when it exists, is
    often of poor quality and lacks sufficient examples and
    explanations. In this paper, we report on an empirical study to
    investigate how Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites, such as
    Stack Overflow, facilitate crowd documentationâ€”knowledge
    that is written by many and read by many. We examine the crowd
    documentation for three popular APIs: Android, GWT, and the Java
    programming language. We collect usage data using Google Code
    Search, and analyze the coverage, quality, and dynamics of the
    Stack Overflow documentation for these APIs. We find that the
    crowd is capable of generating a rich source of content with code
    examples and discussion that is actively viewed and used by many
    more developers. For example, over 35,000 developers contributed
    questions and answers about the Android API, covering 87% of the
    classes. This content has been viewed over 70 million times to
    date. However, there are shortcomings with crowd documentation,
    which we identify. In addition to our empirical study, we present
    future directions and tools that can be leveraged by other
    researchers and software designers for performing API analytics
    and mining of crowd documentation.

    The process of figuring out how to use an API has changed
    radically since Q&amp;A sites (and in
    particular <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>)
    came along. But to what extent can we depend on such sites for
    complete, speedy documentation? Parnin and colleagues looked into
    this, and got some pretty interesting stats (a sample: 87% of all
    classes of the Android API and 77% of the Java API classes have at
    least one thread at StackOverflow; questions are answered in a
    median time of 11 minutes), and some visualization tools for you
    to play with the
    data: <a href="http://blog.ninlabs.com/2012/05/crowd-documentation/">see
