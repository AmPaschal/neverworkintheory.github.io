<p>Many people have noted the wide gulf between the people who study software development and the people who do it. One person trying to close that gap is Michael Feathers, who is running a one-day workshop in London on Wednesday, January 16 titled "<a href="http://codehistorymining.eventbrite.co.uk/">Developing Project Guidance Through Code History Mining</a>". Feathers is the author of the landmark book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/">Working Effectively With Legacy Code</a></em>, and is actively seeking to build ties with people who have similar interests.</p>
<p>Our recommendation: two thumbs up.</p>
