    Social applications on the web let users track and follow the
    activities of a large number of others regardless of location or
    affiliation. There is a potential for this transparency to
    radically improve collaboration and learning in complex
    knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth
    interviews with central and peripheral GitHub users, we examined
    the value of transparency for large-scale distributed
    collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people
    make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the
    networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring
    someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or
    guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of
    thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into
    effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical
    skills and managing their reputation.

    Platforms like GitHub provide an interesting twist to social
    dynamics in open source: they make it easy for everyone to keep
    track of, interact, collaborate, and be aware of the work of other
    developers, including some of the best in the world, all in one
    place. This paper by Dabbish et al reports on work habits and
    perceptions of "central and peripheral" GitHub users. If you're
    new to GitHub, this paper is a good take on its social aspect, but
    if you're already used to working in GitHub, there will be little
    that will surprise you here. Still, I found some cool nuggets that
    might interest you. For instance, that once people amass an
    audience looking at their code production, they become more
    careful about what they make available publicly. Also, that some
    people get followers not because of programming ability or
    personal connections, but because they have "good taste" in the
    projects they themselves follow.
