    Dealing with non-functional requirements (NFRs) has posed a
    challenge onto software engineers for many years. Over the years,
    many methods and techniques have been proposed to improve their
    elicitation, documentation, and validation. Knowing more about the
    state of the practice on these topics may benefit both
    practitioners' and researchers' daily work. A few empirical
    studies have been conducted in the past, but none under the
    perspective of software architects, in spite of the great
    influence that NFRs have on daily architects' practices. This
    paper presents some of the findings of an empirical study based on
    13 interviews with software architects. It addresses questions
    such as: who decides the NFRs, what types of NFRs matter to
    architects, how are NFRs documented, and how are NFRs
    validated. The results are contextualized with existing previous w
    ork.

    In this work, Ameller et al. consider the contention that NFRs
    ought to be driving concerns for software architects. They
    conducted a study with Spanish software architects in a variety of
    domains to understand how they thought of NFRs. Their first
    finding was that no one held a formal "architect" role, although
    that was what their work entailed. The job position was based on
    skills and knowledge rather than training. Their second finding
    was that NFRs were not of primary importance, which contradicts
    other research findings. Instead, they found it was more important
    to consider project-wide constraints like licencing and overall
    cost. This suggests some interesting directions for new research
    in the role architecture plays in the software development
    process.
