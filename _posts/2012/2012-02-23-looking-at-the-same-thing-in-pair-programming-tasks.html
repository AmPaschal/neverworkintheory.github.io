    We present a dual eye-tracking study that demonstrates the effect
    of sharing selection among collaborators in a remote
    pair-programming scenario. Forty pairs of engineering students
    completed several program understanding tasks while their gaze was
    synchronously recorded. The coupling of the programmers' focus of
    attention was measured by a cross- recurrence analysis of gaze
    that captures how much programmers look at the same sequence of
    spots within a short time span. A high level of gaze
    cross-recurrence is typical for pairs who actively engage in
    grounding efforts to build and maintain shared understanding. As
    part of their grounding efforts, programmers may use text
    selection to perform collaborative references. Broadcast
    selections serve as indexing sites for the selector as they
    attract non-selector's gaze shortly after they become
    visible. Gaze cross-recurrence is highest when selectors accompany
    their selections with speech to produce a multimodal reference.

    The fact that pair programming can work pretty well doesn't mean
    that it "just works." Instead, it requires its own set of skills
    and considerations, and perhaps some people are better suited for
    it than others. In a controlled experiment using an eye tracker,
    Jermann and Nüssli show the effect of some of the very low-level
    actions that people in pairs may take to improve their
    performance. Specifically, two seemingly simple kinds of actions
    (talking aloud and selecting the block of text that you're talking
    about) bring your partner's attention to the same screen
    area. When pairs do this, their level of code comprehension
    increases.

    Jermann and Nüssli's study had engineers sitting separately, in
    front of different but shared screens. My guess is that if you and
    your pair are sitting side by side, other actions with the same
    purpose (such as pointing with your finger, or with your mouse)
    should have similar effects.

    couldn't in this case, but remember that researchers are usually
    happy to share their work over email if you ask nicely…)
