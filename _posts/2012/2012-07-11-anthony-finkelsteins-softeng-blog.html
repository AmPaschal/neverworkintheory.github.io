<p><a title="Anthony Finkelstein's blog" href="http://blog.prof.so/">Anthony Finkelstein</a>, the <a title="Finkelstein's academic page" href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/A.Finkelstein/">Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of University College London</a> (and my academic grandfather), has set up <a title="The SoftEng blog" href="http://blog.softeng.info/">a new blog</a> with a similar purpose as ours: he publishes "snappy summaries" of software engineering research with the aim of supporting practitioners. Be sure to check it out! And if you're doing research, I'd suggest you also read his lists of the<a href="http://blog.prof.so/2012/05/top-10-software-engineering-challenges.html"> Top Ten</a> and <a href="http://blog.prof.so/2012/06/bottom-10-software-engineering.html">Bottom Ten Software Engineering Challenges</a>.</p>
