    We carried out a family of controlled experiments to investigate
    whether the use of abbreviated identifier names, with respect to
    full-word identifier names, affects fault fixing in C and Java
    source code. This family consists of an original (or baseline)
    controlled experiment and three replications. We involved 100
    participants with different backgrounds and experiences in
    total. Overall results suggested that there is no difference in
    terms of effort, effectiveness, and efficiency to fix faults, when
    source code contains either only abbreviated or only full-word
    identifier names. We also conducted a qualitative study to
    understand the values, beliefs, and assumptions that inform and
    shape fault fixing when identifier names are either abbreviated or
    full-word. We involved in this qualitative study six professional
    developers with 1--3 years of work experience. A number of insights
    emerged from this qualitative study and can be considered a useful
    complement to the quantitative results from our family of
    experiments. One of the most interesting insights is that
    developers, when working on source code with abbreviated identifier
    names, adopt a more methodical approach to identify and fix faults
    by extending their focus point and only in a few cases do they
    expand abbreviated identifiers.

    Found no difference in development effort or efficiency
    when using abbreviated identifier names as opposed to full names.
