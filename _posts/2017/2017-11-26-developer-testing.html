    Software testing is one of the key activities to software quality in
    practice. Despite its importance, however, we have a remarkable lack
    of knowledge on how developers test in real-world projects. In this
    paper, we report on the surprising results of a large-scale field
    study with 2,443 software engineers whose development activities we
    closely monitored over the course of 2.5 years in four Integrated
    Development Environments (IDEs). Our findings question several
    commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing:
    half of the developers in our study does not test; developers rarely
    run their tests in the IDE; only once they start testing, do they do
    it heftily; most programming sessions end without any test
    execution; only a quarter of test cases is responsible for three
    quarters of all test failures; 12% of tests show flaky behavior;
    Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software
    developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests,
    whereas they think they test half of their time. We observed only
    minor differences in the testing practices among developers in
    different IDEs, Java, and C#. We summarize these practices of
    loosely guiding ones development efforts with the help of testing as
    Test-Guided Development (TGD).
