    Software conflicts arising because of conflicting changes are a regular occurrence 
    and delay projects. The main precept of workspace awareness tools has been to 
    identify potential conflicts early, while changes are still small and easier to 
    resolve. However, in this approach conflicts still occur and require developer 
    time and effort to resolve. We present a novel conflict minimization technique 
    that proactively identifies potential conflicts, encodes them as constraints, and 
    solves the constraint space to recommend a set of conflict-minimal development 
    paths for the team. Here we present a study of four open source projects to 
    characterize the distribution of conflicts and their resolution efforts. We then 
    explain our conflict minimization technique and the design and implementation of 
    this technique in our prototype, Cassandra. We show that Cassandra would have 
    successfully avoided a majority of conflicts in the four open source test subjects. 
    We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying the technique to a 
    simulated set of scenarios with higher than normal incidence of conflicts.

<p>
  To help limit conflicts caused by collaborative software
  development, researchers Kasi and Sarma decided on a <i>Prevention
  is better than cure</i> approach. Why?
</p>
<p>
  In an initial study of four open source projects from GitHub (Perl,
  Storm, Jenkins, and Voldemort) the authors found that merge
  conflicts ranged from 7.6% to 19.3%. Of the clean merges, 2.1% to
  14.7% had build failures and 5.6% to 35% of correct builds incurred
  test failures. Also, each project had different distributions of
  different types of conflicts and different resolution times for each
  conflict type.
</p>
<p>
  Two main conclusions from this work are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <i>Conflicts are the norm rather than the exception</i>. Kasi and
    Sarma report that this is the case no matter the size of the
    project (KLOC) or the number of developers involved. This provides
    an explanation as to why this norm exists in open projects where
    the majority of work is done by a small core group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>There is no one-size-fits-all conflict mitigation
    technique</i>. This conclusion is due to the large variances in
    the results in terms of types and number of conflicts which also
    varied with resolution times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Kasi and Sarma's proactive approach resulted in task scheduling tool
  for conflict minimization that was effective by avoiding the
  majority of conflicts from their experiments.  Considering that the
  conflict resolution times in their study spanned multiple days,
  ranging from an average of 6 to 23 days, Kasi and Sarma's work adds
  another dimension to research in the area conflicting changes
  parallel software development. This work addresses the premise that,
  <b>less conflicts = less time spent on conflict resolution.</b>
