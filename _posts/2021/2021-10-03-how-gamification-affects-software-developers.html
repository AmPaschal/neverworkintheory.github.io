    In May 2016 GitHub removed two counters from developers' profiles
    that tracked their current and longest streaks of uninterrupted daily contributions;
    <cite>Moldon2021</cite> is a study of what happened next.
    Its authors found that long-running streaks became less common,
    as did days in which people made a single contribution to keep their streak going.
    and that weekend contributions declined.
    They also found a decline in streaks across social networks,
    i.e.,
    that if a developer stopped streaking,
    their contacts were more likely to stop streaking as well.

  <p>
    To which I can only respond, "Good."
    Gamification is a deliberate attempt to make systems more addictive,
    and addictive behaviors are never healthy.
    As the authors of <cite>Moldon2021</cite> note:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    â€¦some emotional responses to GitHub's announcement that
    the streak counters were no longer part of developer profiles
    suggest that some developers had developed an unhealthy relationship with these elements.
    It also seems to us unlikely that
    developers logging in to make a single contribution to maintain an ongoing streak
    made useful or high quality contributions.
    This sort of behavior reflects an optimization of individual behavior for the sake of the game,
    and not for the quality of the work.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    But burnout and low-quality work aren't the only risks.
    <cite>Trang2021</cite> found that people were more likely to share privacy-violating information in gamified systems,
    and while some people are incentivized by the competitive nature of leaderboards,
    others (often those who are less self-confident or have been marginalized in the past)
    find them demoralizing.
    They are also a great example of how perverse incentives can distort work in damaging ways:
    if merged code is recognized but code reviews and helpful explanations to newcomers are not,
    your project is not going to be a healthy place to work <cite>Sholler2019</cite>.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  We examine how the behavior of software developers changes in response to
  removing gamification elements from GitHub, an online platform for
  collaborative programming and software development. We find that the
  unannounced removal of daily activity streak counters from the user interface
  (from user profile pages) was followed by significant changes in
  behavior. Long-running streaks of activity were abandoned and became less
  common. Weekend activity decreased and days in which developers made a single
  contribution became less common. Synchronization of streaking behavior in the
  platform's social network also decreased, suggesting that gamification is a
  powerful channel for social influence. Focusing on a set of software
  developers that were publicly pursuing a goal to make contributions for 100
  days in a row, we find that some of these developers abandon this quest
  following the removal of the public streak counter. Our findings provide
  evidence for the significant impact of gamification on the behavior of
  developers on large collaborative programming and software development
  platforms. They urge caution: gamification can steer the behavior of software
  developers in unexpected and unwanted directions.
