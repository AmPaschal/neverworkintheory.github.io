    Last month we <a href="{{'/2021/09/16/analyzing-the-effects-of-tdd-in-github.html' | relative_url}}">wrote</a> that
    we wouldn't review any more papers on test-driven development,
    but <cite>Fucci2020</cite> isn't really about TDD.
    Instead,
    the authors measured how well students wrote tests
    in order to gauge the effects of going a night without sleep.
    By comparing those who slept with those who didn't,
    they found that a single sleepless night reduced code quality by 50%.
    This is consistent with what we know from a century of other studies
    (see <a href="https://igda.org/resources-archive/why-crunch-mode-doesnt-work-six-lessons-2005/">here</a>
    for a short summary,
    and <a href="https://buildtogether.tech/important/#crunch-mode">here</a> for a shorter one);
    I don't expect companies or universities will suddenly start paying attention to the evidence,
    but perhaps now that so many of us are working from home
    it will be easier for us to take naps when we need them.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  We present a quasi-experiment to investigate whether, and to what
  extent, sleep deprivation impacts the performance of novice software
  developers using the agile practice of test-first development
  (TFD). We recruited 45 undergraduates, and asked them to tackle a
  programming task. Among the participants, 23 agreed to stay awake
  the night before carrying out the task, while 22 slept normally. We
  analyzed the quality (i.e., the functional correctness) of the
  implementations delivered by the participants in both groups, their
  engagement in writing source code (i.e., the amount of activities
  performed in the IDE while tackling the programming task) and
  ability to apply TFD (i.e., the extent to which a participant is
  able to apply this practice). By comparing the two groups of
  participants, we found that a single night of sleep deprivation
  leads to a reduction of 50 percent in the quality of the
  implementations. There is notable evidence that the developers'
  engagement and their prowess to apply TFD are negatively
  impacted. Our results also show that sleep-deprived developers make
  more fixes to syntactic mistakes in the source code. We conclude
  that sleep deprivation has possibly disruptive effects on software
  development activities. The results open opportunities for improving
  developers' performance by integrating the study of sleep with other
  psycho-physiological factors in which the software engineering
  research community has recently taken an interest in.
