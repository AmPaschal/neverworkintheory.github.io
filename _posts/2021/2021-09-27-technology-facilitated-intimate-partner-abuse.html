    In my experience,
    most classes on computer security discuss things like
    hackers using buffer overflow exploits to steal credit card information.
    They rarely mention that if you go to a family shelter in the middle of the night
    to escape a physically abusive partner,
    one of the first things they get you to do is turn off your phone,
    because whoever is abusing you has probably installed spyware
    to track your location and read your texts and email.

  <p>
    <cite>Leitao2019</cite> is a good introduction to so-called "intimate threats".
    In it,
    the author describes how the tools and skills used to "keep tabs on her" are shared in online forums,
    how the software sold by the surveillance industry to keep children safe
    is routinely repurposed to control the victims of domestic abuse,
    and the advice that victims and survivors share amongst themselves
    (which is sometimes inaccurate or incomplete).
    The paper does not offer any simple conclusions or remedies;
    instead,
    I think it can and should spark discussion about everything from
    what data apps should collect and share
    to what legal sanctions programmers and their employers should face
    for creating things that they know are use to do harm.

  <p>
    <cite>Leitao2019</cite> is uncomfortable reading,
    which is why I think our profession prefers to focus on
    scenarios where business profits are threatened
    rather than ones where the targets are merely vulnerable people.
    Precisely because of that,
    I think the security and ethics lectures in most software engineering courses
    would be more likely to actually change students' beliefs and behaviors
    if their starting point was research like this.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  This article reports on a qualitative analysis of data gathered from three
  online discussion forums for victims and survivors of domestic abuse. The
  analysis focussed on technology-facilitated abuse and the findings cover three
  main themes, namely, 1) forms of technology-facilitated abuse being discussed
  on the forums, 2) the ways in which forum members are using technology within
  the context of intimate partner abuse, and 3) the digital privacy and security
  advice being exchanged between victims/survivors on the forums. The article
  concludes with a discussion on the dual role of digital technologies within
  the context of intimate partner abuse, on the challenges and advantages of
  digital ubiquity, as well as on the issues surrounding digital evidence of
  abuse, and the labor of managing digital privacy and security.
