    The short answer to the question posed by <cite>McIntosh2021</cite>'s title is "probably not".
    They analyzed the GitHub repositories of almost twelve thousand hackathon projects from 2018–19
    and found that:

  <blockquote>
    …approximately 85% of commits were made within the first month,
    and approximately 77% of the total commits occurred within the first week.
    Only 7% of projects had any activity 6 months after the event ended.
    Evaluated projects had an average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates…

    That said,
    this paper doesn't look at the long-term impact of hackathons on the participants themselves.
    In my experience,
    many people participate in hackathons to build new social connections
    and to learn how to create, review, and merge changes.
    Those impacts don't show up directly in the hackathons' own repositories;
    pointers to studies would be very welcome.

  Hackathons, the increasingly popular collaborative technology
  challenge events, are praised for producing modern solutions to real
  world problems. They have, however, recently been criticized for
  positing that serious real world problems can be solved in 24-48
  hours of undergraduate coding. Projects created at hackathons are
  typically demos or proof-of-concepts, and little is known about the
  fate of them after the hackathon ends. Do they receive continued
  development in preparation for real world use and maintenance as
  part of actually being used, or are they abandoned? Since
  participants often use GitHub (Microsoft's popular version control
  system), it is possible to check. This quantitative, empirical study
  uses a series of Python scripts to complete a robust analysis of
  development patterns for all 11,889 of the U.S. based 2018-2019
  Major League Hacking (MLH) affiliated hackathon projects which had
  GitHub repositories. Of these projects, approximately 85% of commits
  were made within the first month, and approximately 77% of the total
  commits occurred within the first week. Only 7% of projects had any
  activity 6 months after the event ended. Evaluated projects had an
  average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates, and the average of
  commits divided by the length of the development period was only
  0.1. This indicates that few projects receive the post-event
  attention expected of an actively developed project. Finally, this
  study offers a dialogue of possible ways to reformat hackathons to
  help increase the average longevity of the development period for
  projects.
