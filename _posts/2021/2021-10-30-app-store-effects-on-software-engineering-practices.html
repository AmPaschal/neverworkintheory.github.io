  <p>
    I once heard an athletics coach say,
    "If you change the ball, you have to change the game."
    What she meant was that you can't play football with a tennis ball or vice versa,
    and something similar is proving true in software engineering.
    Once enough people have reliable high-bandwidth connections,
    chat tools and package repositories become feasible,
    and development practices inevitably change in response.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>AlSubaihin2021</cite> looks at the influence one innovation—app stores—are
    having on how developers work.
    The biggest impact is on requirements and design:
    most developers look in app stores to gauge the feasibility of their idea
    and for UI design ideas,
    and are most influenced by user reviews and screenshots.
    Later in the cycle,
    problem reports on the app store have significant impact on bug prioritization,
    and the ability to send update notifications through the app store
    enables more rapid release cycles.
  </p>

    One thing I wish the paper had included was
    a discussion of how app stores are changing the way that
    developers think about the ethics of data collection.
    The authors report that:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      …[a]pp permissions are a worrying factor during development as importing unnecessary APIs
      might bloat the permissions list thus making an app less desirable.
      Furthermore,
      during the construction phase,
      developers settle on tracking strategy in order to implant tracking code within the app.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    but as far as I can see,
    there was nothing about looking at existing apps to figure out
    how little data could be collected or how it could be anonymized.
    We recently started tracking traffic to this site using <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>,
    an open-source, <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics">privacy-first</a> metrics tool,
    so an empirical analysis of how the growth of app stores is affecting
    how developers think about surveillance
    would be a great extension to Al-Subaihin et al's work.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  In this paper, we study the app store as a phenomenon from the
  developers' perspective to investigate the extent to which app
  stores affect software engineering tasks. Through developer
  interviews and questionnaires, we uncover findings that highlight
  and quantify the effects of three high-level app store themes:
  bridging the gap between developers and users, increasing market
  transparency and affecting mobile release management. Our findings
  have implications for testing, requirements engineering and mining
  software repositories research fields. These findings can help guide
  future research in supporting mobile app developers through a deeper
  understanding of the app store-developer interaction.
