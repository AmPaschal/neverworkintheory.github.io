<div class="review">
  <p>
    I went through a lot of interviews after being laid off by RStudio earlier this year.
    Some really impressed me---in particular,
    I think <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>'s
    <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers/">hiring process</a>
    was excellent---but many were haphazard, confusing,
    or <a href="https://third-bit.com/2021/09/13/iq-and-personality-tests/">misguided</a>.
    I'm not alone in feeling this way:
    <cite>Behroozi2019</cite> found that
    the questions asked in technical interviews are often seen as irrelevant to actual work,
    frequently depend on knowledge of trivia,
    cause a lot of anxiety (which means the results aren't representative of on-job performance),
    and bias the process in favor of people with lots of free time
    (i.e., who don't have kids or are affluent enough to be able to quit one job
    before getting the next).
  </p>
  <p>
    These complaints are as common as the bad practices that inspire them.
    What makes <cite>Behroozi2020</cite> stand out is that
    it goes beyond complaining to analyze what exactly goes wrong
    and how it could be fixed.
    It breaks the process down into five stages:
    contact, preparation, interviews, hearing back, and offer &amp; negotiation.
    The guidelines it presents probably won't surprise you,
    but few companies actually implement all of them.
    I think our industry would be healthier if more did.

  Technical interviews—a problem-solving form of interview in which
  candidates write code—are commonplace in the software industry, and
  are used by several well-known companies including Facebook, Google,
  and Microsoft. These interviews are intended to objectively assess
  candidates and determine fit within the company. But what do
  developers say about them?To understand developer perceptions about
  technical interviews, we conducted a qualitative study using the
  online social news website, Hacker News—a venue for software
  practitioners. Hacker News posters report several concerns and
  negative perceptions about interviews, including their lack of
  real-world relevance, bias towards younger developers, and demanding
  time commitment. Posters report that these interviews cause
  unnecessary anxiety and frustration, requiring them to learn
  arbitrary, implicit, and obscure norms. The findings from our study
  inform inclusive hiring guidelines for technical interviews, such as
  collaborative problem-solving sessions.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  The typical hiring pipeline for software engineering occurs over
  several stages—from phone screening and technical on-site
  interviews, to offer and negotiation. When these hiring pipelines
  are "leaky," otherwise qualified candidates are lost at some stage
  of the pipeline. These leaky pipelines impact companies in several
  ways, including hindering a company's ability to recruit competitive
  candidates and build diverse software teams.To understand where
  candidates become disengaged in the hiring pipeline—and what
  companies can do to prevent it—we conducted a qualitative study on
  over 10,000 reviews on 19 companies from Glassdoor, a website where
  candidates can leave reviews about their hiring process
  experiences. We identified several poor practices which prematurely
  sabotage the hiring process—for example, not adequately
  communicating hiring criteria, conducting interviews with
  inexperienced interviewers, and ghosting candidates. Our findings
  provide a set of guidelines to help companies improve their hiring
  pipeline practices—such as being deliberate about phrasing and
  language during initial contact with the candidate, providing
  candidates with constructive feedback after their interviews, and
  bringing salary transparency and long-term career discussions into
  offers and negotiations. Operationalizing these guidelines helps
  make the hiring pipeline more transparent, fair, and
  inclusive.
