    When I was first introduced to SQL in my undergraduate database course, we
    were trained on an Oracle SQL instance. <cite>Taipalus2021</cite> provides
    evidence that I may have been just a bit happier had we used PostgreSQL
    instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Taipalus2021</cite> studied how choice of database management system
    (DBMS) affected the effectiveness and subjective experience of novices
    when correcting SQL syntax errors. Overall, novices reported that the
    error messages produced by PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server were more
    useful than error messages from MySQL, meanwhile Oracle's error messages
    were usually deemed the least usefulâ€”perhaps because its messages
    generally do a poor job of indicating where an error occurs in a query.
    However the practical differences are slight: to put it in perspective,
    expect a 3/5 star rating for Oracle's error messages to a 4/5 rating for
    PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
  </p>
  <p>
    In almost all cases, the choice of DBMS and their associated error
    messages had little effect on whether the novices could actually fix the
    error. So even if you choose PostgreSQL over MySQL for your next project,
    you'll still need to spend time training juniors how to write queries.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  The database and the database management system (DBMS) are two of
  the main components of any information system. Structured Query
  Language (SQL) is the most popular query language for retrieving
  data from the database, as well as for many other data management
  tasks. During system development and maintenance, software
  developers use a considerable amount of time to interpret compiler
  error messages. The quality of these error messages has been
  demonstrated to affect software development effectiveness, and
  correctly formulating queries and fixing them when needed is an
  important task for many software developers. In this study, we set
  out to investigate how participants (N = 152) experienced the
  qualities of error messages of four popular DBMSs in terms of error
  message effectiveness, perceived usefulness for finding and fixing
  errors, and error recovery confidence. Our results show differences
  between the DBMSs by three of the four metrics, and indicate a
  discrepancy between objective effectiveness and subjective
  usefulness. The results suggest that although error messages have
  perceived differences in terms of usefulness for finding and fixing
  errors, these differences may not necessarily result in differences
  in query fixing success rates.
