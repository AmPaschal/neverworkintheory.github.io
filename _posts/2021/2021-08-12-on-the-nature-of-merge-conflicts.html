  <p>
    I'm going to start this review with a minor complaint, but end it
    with praise. The abstracts of many software engineering papers are
    like movie trailers rather than summaries: they tell you that
    there are great things in the paper, but don't tell you precisely
    what they are.  For example, <cite>Ghiotto2020</cite>'s abstract closes with
    the teaser, "Our results give rise to three primary
    recommendations for future merge techniques, that—when
    implemented—could on one hand help in automatically resolving
    certain types of conflicts and on the other hand provide the
    developer with tool-based assistance to more easily resolve other
    types of conflicts that cannot be automatically resolved." As
    someone skimming through several dozen papers to decide which ones
    to read in depth, I wish those three recommendations were right
    there in the abstract in the way that the main findings of
    clinical medicine papers are. If you are a reviewer or an editor,
    please ask authors to do this.
  </p>
  <p>
    That minor gripe aside, this is a good paper about an important
    topic. Its introduction sets the stage and asks good questions:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    …it has been reported that 10% to 20% of all merges fail, with some
    projects experiencing rates of almost 50%. To spur the development
    of new merge techniques that could potentially reduce the high
    failure rate, we posit that it is necessary to take a deep dive
    into the nature of merge conflicts and how they are resolved. What
    do they look like, exactly? How do developers resolve them? Do any
    relationships exist between the nature of certain merge conflicts
    and the resolution strategies chosen by developers?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The authors then make those questions much more precise:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      What is the distribution in number of conflicting chunks for merge failures?
    </li>
    <li>
      What is the distribution in size of conflicting chunks, as measured in lines of code (LOC)?
    </li>
    <li>
      What is the distribution in language constructs involved in conflicting chunks?
    </li>
    <li>
      What, if any, patterns exist in the language constructs of failed merges involving multiple conflicting chunks?
    </li>
    <li>
      What is the distribution of developer decisions?
    </li>
    <li>
      What is the distribution in difficulty level of kinds of con- flicts?
    </li>
    <li>
      What, if any, patterns exist between the language constructs of conflicting chunks and developers’ decisions?
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    They are also precise in their classification of developer decisions:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    We study developer decisions on a conflicting chunk by conflicting
    chunk basis, and identify six different ways of resolving a
    conflict: (1) adopt the code of version 1 in the local repository,
    (2) adopt the code of version 2 from the repository, (3)
    concatenate both versions wholesale, in either order, (4)
    incorporate in some interleaving order select lines of code from
    both versions, without writing any new lines or modifying selected
    lines, (5) mix existing code from one of both versions with newly
    written code, and (6) use none of the versions, that is, the
    developer discards both versions and adopts the base version
    (original version before the parallel work).
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I found their answer to their fifth question to be most
    interesting: developers usually pick one or the other of the
    source code chunks, and writing new code to resolve a merge
    conflict is less common than expected. This result led to the
    authors rethinking the kinds of tools that would help developers
    most:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    …across all 616 conflicting chunks studied in the manual analysis,
    a primary choice that developers make is to select one of the
    versions, either version 1 (V1, 21%) or version 2 (V2, 35%). This
    was, to us, an unexpected result. Given all the commentary and
    folklore surrounding the merge problem and how difficult it is
    said to be to resolve merge conflicts…we had expected new code
    (NC) to be the most common choice. It is not: only 19% of chunks
    are resolved by writing some new code as part of the resolution.
    This means that a full 81% of the conflicting chunks are resolved
    using only the contents from the code contained within the chunk
    without actually adding or editing lines of code (V1, V2, CC, and
    CB; note that NN is negligible, because it occurs so
    infrequently). While this does not necessarily mean that doing so
    is trivial, it does mean that merge resolution through one of
    these four strategies could be supported not by yet more
    automation, but perhaps by tool support that assists developers in
    making one of these four choices in the first place and, in case
    of CC and CB, by helping them select and order the necessary lines
    of code.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Their breakdown of merge difficulty by language feature is also
    interesting, and is the kind of thing that would feed directly
    into tool design, which leads to the three key points that
    motivate the recommendations mentioned at the start:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>Conflicting chunks generally contain all the necessary
      information to resolve them</em> (so a tool should allow users
      to reshuffle things quickly, especially since 94% of conflicting
      chunks were 50 lines long or less).
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Resolution order of conflicting chunks can matter.</em>
      For example, how the user resolves a conflict in a method
      signature can and should inform the options for resolving
      conflicts in invocations of that method.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Past choices of how conflicting chunks were resolved can
	inform future choices.</em> There are patterns in how some
	users resolve conflicts; that history can make resolution of
	future conflicts faster.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Findings and recommendations like these are why I think software
    developers should pay attention to software engineering
    research. I've done two large merges so far today, and expect to
    do three more before the end of the week. If better tools can
    make that easier, it will have a direct impact on my working
    life, and studies like this one are how we'll get tools that are
    actually better rather than merely different.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  When multiple developers change a software system in parallel, these
  concurrent changes need to be merged to all appear in the software
  being developed. Numerous merge techniques have been proposed to
  support this task, but none of them can fully automate the merge
  process. Indeed, it has been reported that as much as 10 to 20
  percent of all merge attempts result in a merge conflict, meaning
  that a developer has to manually complete the merge. To date, we
  have little insight into the nature of these merge conflicts. What
  do they look like, in detail? How do developers resolve them? Do any
  patterns exist that might suggest new merge techniques that could
  reduce the manual effort? This paper contributes an in-depth study
  of the merge conflicts found in the histories of 2,731 open source
  Java projects. Seeded by the manual analysis of the histories of
  five projects, our automated analysis of all 2,731 projects: (1)
  characterizes the merge conflicts in terms of number of chunks,
  size, and programming language constructs involved, (2) classifies
  the manual resolution strategies that developers use to address
  these merge conflicts, and (3) analyzes the relationships between
  various characteristics of the merge conflicts and the chosen
  resolution strategies. Our results give rise to three primary
  recommendations for future merge techniques, that—when
  implemented—could on one hand help in automatically resolving
  certain types of conflicts and on the other hand provide the
  developer with tool-based assistance to more easily resolve other
  types of conflicts that cannot be automatically resolved.
