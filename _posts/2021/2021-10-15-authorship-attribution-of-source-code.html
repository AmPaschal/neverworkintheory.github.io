    The question, "Who actually wrote this code?" comes up in many contexts,
    from plagiarism detection in schoolwork to design recovery in legacy systems.
    <cite>Bogomolov2021</cite> presents two machine learning approaches to the problem
    using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">random forests</a>.
    Unlike most earlier work,
    these models operate on paths through the source code's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax tree</a> (AST).
    The authors find that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      their random forest approach outperforms the previous best result on C++,
    </li>
    <li>
      it matches the best performance of previous systems on Python, and
    </li>
    <li>
      both of their approaches outperform previous results on Java.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I have reservations about how eagerly and uncritically some researchers are applying machine learning to software engineering problems,
    but this study seems to have been well designed and well controlled,
    and their use of ASTs to make their tools language-agnostic is really interesting.
    I look forward to hearing more from this team.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Authorship attribution (i.e., determining who is the author of a
  piece of source code) is an established research
  topic. State-of-the-art results for the authorship attribution
  problem look promising for the software engineering field, where
  they could be applied to detect plagiarized code and prevent legal
  issues. With this article, we first introduce a new
  language-agnostic approach to authorship attribution of source
  code. Then, we discuss limitations of existing synthetic datasets
  for authorship attribution, and propose a data collection approach
  that delivers datasets that better reflect aspects important for
  potential practical use in software engineering. Finally, we
  demonstrate that high accuracy of authorship attribution models on
  existing datasets drastically drops when they are evaluated on more
  realistic data. We outline next steps for the design and evaluation
  of authorship attribution models that could bring the research
  efforts closer to practical use for software
  engineering.
