    I spoke with someone earlier this year who had been using the Unix shell for several years
    but had never used the <code>man</code> command.
    Whenever they had a question they went to Stack Overflow:
    experience had taught them that they could find their answer there
    more quickly than by hunting through comprehensive breadth-first documentation
    written by people who are guessing what the reader wants to know
    rather than responding to the actual gaps in their knowledge.
    (See <a href="https://third-bit.com/2019/08/08/documentation-types/">this post</a>
    for more on documentation types and their audiences.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The answers on Stack Overflow are only part of the story, though.
    As <cite>Zhang2020</cite> shows,
    a lot of the value is in the comments.
    Most of these are added <em>after</em> an answer is accepted;
    half are fast responses (added within one day of an answer being posted),
    but later comments tend to be more informative.
    Question posters rarely integrate comments back into answers,
    and inexperienced users tend to raise limitations and concerns
    while experienced users tend to enhance the answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stack Overflow is not a level playing field:
    as <cite>Ford2016</cite> showed,
    it is <a href="{{'/2016/09/21/paradise-unplugged.html' | relative_url}}">a less friendly place for women than it is for men</a>,
    which means its growing importance has only exacerbated tech's deep-seated biases.
    Hopefully,
    studies like <cite>Zhang2020</cite> that give us more insight into how it's used
    will also help us make it a more level playing field.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Stack Overflow is one of the most active communities for developers to share
  their programming knowledge. Answers posted on Stack Overflow help developers
  solve issues during software development. In addition to posting answers,
  users can also post comments to further discuss their associated answers. As
  of Aug 2017, there are 32.3 million comments that are associated with answers,
  forming a large collection of crowdsourced repository of knowledge on top of
  the commonly-studied Stack Overflow answers. In this study, we wish to
  understand how the commenting activities contribute to the crowdsourced
  knowledge. We investigate what users discuss in comments, and analyze the
  characteristics of the commenting dynamics, (i.e., the timing of commenting
  activities and the roles of commenters). We find that: 1) the majority of
  comments are informative and thus can enhance their associated answers from a
  diverse range of perspectives. However, some comments contain content that is
  discouraged by Stack Overflow. 2) The majority of commenting activities occur
  after the acceptance of an answer. More than half of the comments are fast
  responses occurring within one day of the creation of an answer, while later
  comments tend to be more informative. Most comments are rarely integrated back
  into their associated answers, even though such comments are informative. 3)
  Insiders (i.e., users who posted questions/answers before posting a comment in
  a question thread) post the majority of comments within one month, and
  outsiders (i.e., users who never posted any question/answer before posting a
  comment) post the majority of comments after one month. Inexperienced users
  tend to raise limitations and concerns while experienced users tend to enhance
  the answer through commenting. Our study provides insights into the commenting
  activities in terms of their content, timing, and the individuals who perform
  the commenting. For the purpose of long-term knowledge maintenance and
  effective information retrieval for developers, we also provide actionable
  suggestions to encourage Stack Overflow users/engineers/moderators to leverage
  our insights for enhancing the current Stack Overflow commenting system for
  improving the maintenance and organization of the crowdsourced
  knowledge.
