  <p>
    The URL ranks up there with the Unix pipe as one of the great practical innovations in computing.
    We use them in dozens of different ways without really noticing them any longer,
    but calling them "links" isn't accurate:
    they are pointers,
    and the things they point to can change, move, or disappear over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    This paper looks at URLs embedded in source code.
    Over 80% of repositories contain at least one link;
    licenses and projects' home pages are the most common "internal" links,
    while links to external domains obey a long tail distribution
    with GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Wikipedia being the most common.
    Almost 10% of links are dead overall,
    but the less common a site is as a link target in general,
    the more likely it is that a link to it no longer works,
    and links are rarely updated after they're committed.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what are links used for?
    In descending order:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      metadata, like the author, a related organization, or the license;
    </li>
    <li>
      source/attribution: the link points to the source of an algorithm or something similar;
    </li>
    <li>
      source code context: the link adds miscellaneous information to the source code;
    </li>
    <li>
      see-also: the link points to additional reading material;
    </li>
    <li>
      commented-out source code: the link is part of the source code, e.g., as a parameter value, but has been commented out;
    </li>
    <li>
      link-only: the comment only contains the link;
    </li>
    <li>
      self-admitted technical debt: bug-related, like workaround, under development, and so on; and
    </li>
    <li>
      @see: the link is accompanied by “@see”, but no further explanation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    One thing the paper doesn't discuss that I'd like to know is
    how often programmers automate checks for the links in their source code.
    I routinely use tools like <code>pylint</code> and <code>ESLint</code>
    to check that my code conforms to style guidelines,
    but to the best of my knowledge they don't check external links in comments.
    It would be interesting to see what developers would do if dead links made CI jobs fail.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Links are an essential feature of the World Wide Web, and source code
  repositories are no exception. However, despite their many undisputed
  benefits, links can suffer from decay, insufficient versioning, and lack of
  bidirectional traceability. In this paper, we investigate the role of links
  contained in source code comments from these perspectives. We conducted a
  large-scale study of around 9.6 million links to establish their prevalence,
  and we used a mixed-methods approach to identify the links' targets, purposes,
  decay, and evolutionary aspects. We found that links are prevalent in source
  code repositories, that licenses, software homepages, and specifications are
  common types of link targets, and that links are often included to provide
  metadata or attribution. Links are rarely updated, but many link targets
  evolve. Almost 10% of the links included in source code comments are dead. We
  then submitted a batch of link-fixing pull requests to open source software
  repositories, resulting in most of our fixes being merged successfully. Our
  findings indicate that links in source code comments can indeed be fragile,
  and our work opens up avenues for future work to address these
  problems.
