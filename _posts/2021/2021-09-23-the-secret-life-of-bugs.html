    Twelve years ago,
    <cite>Aranda2009</cite> forced me to rethink a lot of what I thought about software engineering research.
    Its authors (one of whom later co-founded this site)
    looked closely at the histories of ten randomly-selected bugs at Microsoft,
    comparing the electronic records (like version control commits and email messages)
    with detailed interviews of 26 people.
    Their conclusion:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The most striking lesson from our cases is the deep unreliability of electronic traces,
    and particularly of the bug records,
    which were erroneous or misleading in seven of our ten cases, and incomplete and insufficient in <em>every</em> case.
    In fact,
    even considering all of the electronic traces of a bug that we could find
    (repositories, email conversations, meeting requests, specifications, document revisions, and organizational structure records),
    in <em>every case but one</em> the histories omitted important details about the bug.

    I think we can learn a lot about software and the people who create it
    by mining and analyzing digital data.
    Since reading this paper, though,
    one of the first things I check when reviewing a data mining paper
    is whether the authors thought carefully about what that data <em>didn't</em> capture.
    If they don't address that issue (which unfortunately many don't),
    I'm much more skeptical about the paper's claims.
    If this site ever does turn into the evidence-based introduction to software engineering
    that I've wanted for over a decade,
    this paper will be one of the first required readings.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Every bug has a story behind it. The people that discover and resolve it need
  to coordinate, to get information from documents, tools, or other people, and
  to navigate through issues of accountability, ownership, and organizational
  structure. This paper reports on a field study of coordination activities
  around bug fixing that used a combination of case study research and a survey
  of software professionals. Results show that the histories of even simple bugs
  are strongly dependent on social, organizational, and technical knowledge that
  cannot be solely extracted through automation of electronic repositories, and
  that such automation provides incomplete and often erroneous accounts of
  coordination. The paper uses rich bug histories and survey results to identify
  common bug fixing coordination patterns and to provide implications for tool
  designers and researchers of coordination in software
  development.
