    Few things are as annoying as being interrupted when you're trying to—no,
    thank you, I don't want another cup of tea just yet. As I was saying, few
    things are—pardon me? Sure, lasagna would be fine. Anyway, few things
    are—no, I don't where your headphones are. Now, where was I?

    This study looked at what kinds of interruptions have the most effect on
    programmers' work. One finding is that the time of day and whether or not
    the interruption was internal or external mattered more than its priority or
    what stage of work the programmer was in when the interruption occurred.
    The real surprise was that programmers thought external interruptions were
    more disruptive that internal ones (i.e., self-interruptions), but the
    reverse was actually true.

    One thing I particularly liked about this paper was its inclusion of tips
    for practitioners. My favorite was, "less experienced software developers
    find it harder to capture the context they were in before switching their
    primary task and they are most likely to need to backtrack further when they
    resume their interrupted tasks. Thus, software developers should ask their
    unplanned questions from co-workers who are more experienced in the topic
    related to their ongoing task."

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Multitasking has always been an inherent part of software development and is
  known as the primary source of interruptions due to task switching in software
  development teams.  Developing software involves a mix of analytical and
  creative work, and requires a significant load on brain functions, such as
  working memory and decision making.  Thus, task switching in the context of
  software development imposes a cognitive load that causes software developers
  to lose focus and concentration while working thereby taking a toll on
  productivity.  To investigate the disruptiveness of task switching and
  interruptions in software development projects, and to understand the reasons
  for and perceptions of the disruptiveness of task switching we used a
  mixed-methods approach including a longitudinal data analysis on 4,910
  recorded tasks of 17 professional software developers, and a survey of 132
  software developers.  We found that, compared to task-specific factors
  (e.g. priority, level, and temporal stage), contextual factors such as
  interruption type (e.g. self/external), time of day, and task type and context
  are a more potent determinant of task switching disruptiveness in software
  development tasks.  Furthermore, while most survey respondents believe
  external interruptions are more disruptive than self-interruptions, the
  results of our retrospective analysis reveals otherwise.  We found that
  self-interruptions (i.e. voluntary task switchings) are more disruptive than
  external interruptions and have a negative effect on the performance of the
  interrupted tasks.  Finally, we use the results of both studies to provide a
  set of comparative vulnerability and interaction patterns which can be used as
  a mean to guide decision-making and forecasting the consequences of task
  switching in software development teams.
