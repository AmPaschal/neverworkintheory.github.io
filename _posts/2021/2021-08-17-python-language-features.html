    Most languages work very hard to preserve backward compatibility, even at the expense of present ease of use.
    The Python community's decision to release Python 3 in 2008 was therefore a step into the unknown,
    and one that took many years to pay off
    Ten years later, <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Malloy2018">Malloy2018</a> found that
    most programmers were still using a backward-compatible subset of the language.
    Even now, more than a year after the end of official support for Python 2,
    I routinely encounter active projects that haven't upgraded and probably never will.
    My takeaway is that even if the name stays the same,
    something that is not backward-compatible is effectively a new language,
    and its creators have to expect that it will take years for the changes to be adopted.

    Rather than looking at the before and after,
    <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Peng2021">Peng2021</a> looks at current usage (as of 2021).
    Its authors scanned 35 projects from 8 application domains containing 4.3 million lines of code
    to find out how often different features are used.
    I wasn't surprised to see single inheritance at the top of the list,
    but I <em>was</em> surprised that decorators came second.
    Keyword arguments, for loops, and nested classes are practically tied for third place;
    again, I wouldn't have predicted that nested classes were that heavily used,
    which makes me wonder whether my personal Python style is atypical
    or whether nested classes are just more common in domains I don't work in.
  </p>
  <p>
    One cool thing about Peng et al's work is that
    the tool they use to scan projects is <a href="https://github.com/S4Plus/PyScan">available on GitHub</a>
    so that other researchers can extend it and/or re-do their analysis
    to see how feature use changes over time.
    I think programming languages would be more usable and more useful
    if their design was informed by studies like this
    and

    we have covered in the past.

  Python is one of the most popular and widely adopted programming languages in
  use today. In 2008 the Python developers introduced a new version of the
  language, Python 3.0, that was not backward compatible with Python 2,
  initiating a transitional phase for Python software developers. In this paper,
  we describe a study that investigates the degree to which Python software
  developers are making the transition from Python 2 to Python 3. We have
  developed a Python compliance analyser, PyComply, and have analysed a
  previously studied corpus of Python applications called Qualitas. We use
  PyComply to measure and quantify the degree to which Python 3 features are
  being used, as well as the rate and context of their adoption in the Qualitas
  corpus. Our results indicate that Python software developers are not
  exploiting the new features and advantages of Python 3, but rather are
  choosing to retain backward compatibility with Python 2. Moreover, Python
  developers are confining themselves to a language subset, governed by the
  diminishing intersection of Python 2, which is not under development, and
  Python 3, which is under development with new features being introduced as the
  language continues to evolve.

  As a dynamic programming language, Python is widely used in many fields. For
  developers, various language features affect programming experience. For
  researchers, they affect the difficulty of developing tasks such as bug
  finding and compilation optimization. Former research has shown that programs
  with Python dynamic features are more change-prone. However, we know little
  about the use and impact of Python language features in real-world Python
  projects. To resolve these issues, we systematically analyze Python language
  features and propose a tool named PYSCAN to automatically identify the use of
  22 kinds of common Python language features in 6 categories in Python source
  code. We conduct an empirical study on 35 popular Python projects from eight
  application domains, covering over 4.3 million lines of code, to investigate
  the the usage of these language features in the project. We find that single
  inheritance, decorator, keyword argument, for loops and nested classes are top
  5 used language features. Meanwhile different domains of projects may prefer
  some certain language features. For example, projects in DevOps use exception
  handling frequently. We also conduct in-depth manual analysis to dig extensive
  using patterns of frequently but differently used language features:
  exceptions, decorators and nested classes/functions. We find that developers
  care most about ImportError when handling exceptions. With the empirical
  results and in-depth analysis, we conclude with some suggestions and a
  discussion of implications for three groups of persons in Python community:
  Python designers, Python compiler designers and Python developers.
