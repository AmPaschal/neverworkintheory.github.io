<div class="review">
  <p>
    Today is my fourth day in the first full-time programming job I've had in ten years.
    Some things have stayed the same (meetings, t-shirts, and package management problems),
    but others have changed:
    I'm finally going to have to learn how to use Docker and cloud-based microservices,
    and where pre- and post-commit hooks were a rarity a decade ago,
    almost every step of development is now supported by automated checks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Kinsman2021</cite> looks at how teams use GitHub Actions
    to implement those checks and support development workflows in other ways.
    They found that the most common operations are (in order)
    continuous integration,
    miscellaneous utilities (such as reading configuration files),
    deployment,
    publishing,
    and code quality/code review,
    with a long tail of other kinds of actions.
    (Almost 40% of the actions they found fell into the "Uncategorized" bucket.)
    As for impact,
    they found that after adopting GitHub Actions,
    projects had more rejected pull requests and fewer commits on merged pull requests;
    adopting Actions <em>didn't</em> affect the number of merged pull requests,
    the rate of comments on PRs,
    or several other variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actions were still fairly new when the study was done,
    so I hope the authors will do a follow-up.
    Better yet,
    I hope they will automate their data collection and analysis to provide continuous updates,
    which would be in the spirit of what they are studying.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Automated tools are frequently used in social coding repositories to
  perform repetitive activities that are part of the distributed
  software development process. Recently, GitHub introduced GitHub
  Actions, a feature providing automated work-flows for repository
  maintainers. Although several Actions have been built and used by
  practitioners, relatively little has been done to evaluate
  them. Understanding and anticipating the effects of adopting such
  kind of technology is important for planning and management. Our
  research is the first to investigate how developers use Actions and
  how several activity indicators change after their adoption. Our
  results indicate that, although only a small subset of repositories
  adopted GitHub Actions to date, there is a positive perception of
  the technology. Our findings also indicate that the adoption of
  GitHub Actions increases the number of monthly rejected pull
  requests and decreases the monthly number of commits on merged pull
  requests. These results are especially relevant for practitioners to
  understand and prevent undesirable effects on their
  projects.
