    You don't realize what barriers people face if you've never had to get over them.
    I used to tell people that open source was a great leveller
    because everyone could contribute.
    I now realize that claim needs to be qualified with,
    "…provided they're affluent enough to have free time and good internet connectivity,
    speak English well enough to join a mostly monolingual conversation,
    and if they're not white and/or not male,
    willing to put up with a steady drizzle of disparagement or harassment."

  <p>
    <cite>Han2021</cite> is therefore a very welcome look at
    some of what's happening outside my bubble.
    As the authors say,
    "…many Chinese technology companies are embracing open source
    and choosing to open source their projects.
    Nevertheless,
    most previous studies are concentrated on international companies
    such as Microsoft or Google…"
    They examined a thousand projects that have been open sourced by Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent,
    and surveyed a hundred of the programmers involved.
    Among other things, they find that:

  <ul>
    <li>
      the most common reasons to open source a project are to gain fame,
      expand influence,
      and help with recruiting;
    </li>
    <li>
      the most common internationalization effort is
      providing an English version of the project's README files,
      and
    </li>
    <li>
      projects that put more effort into internationalization are (still) more popular.
    </li>
  </ul>

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Open source software has drawn more and more attention from
  researchers, developers and companies nowadays. Meanwhile, many
  Chinese technology companies are embracing open source and choosing
  to open source their projects. Nevertheless, most previous studies
  are concentrated on international companies such as Microsoft or
  Google, while the practical values of open source projects of
  Chinese technology companies remain unclear. To address this issue,
  we conduct a mixed-method study to investigate the landscape of
  projects open sourced by three large Chinese technology companies,
  namely Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (BAT). We study the categories
  and characteristics of open source projects, the developer's
  perceptions towards open sourcing effort for these companies, and
  the internationalization effort of their open source projects. We
  collected 1,000 open source projects that were open sourced by BAT
  in GitHub and performed an online survey that received 101 responses
  from developers of these projects. Some key findings include: 1) BAT
  prefer to open source frontend development projects, 2) 88% of the
  respondents are positive towards open sourcing software projects in
  their respective companies, 3) 64% of the respondents reveal that
  the most common motivations for BAT to open source their projects
  are the desire to gain fame, expand their influence and gain
  recruitment advantage, 4) respondents believe that the most common
  internationalization effort is ``providing an English version of
  readme files'', 5) projects with more internationalization effort
  (i.e., include an English readme file) are more popular. Our
  findings provide directions for software engineering researchers and
  provide practical suggestions to software developers and Chinese
  technology companies.
