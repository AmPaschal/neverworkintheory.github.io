    <cite>Muhammad2019</cite> opens by saying,
    "Package management is instrumental for programming languages and operating systems,
    and yet it is neglected by both areas as an implementation detail,"
    to which I can only reply, "Amen."
    The authors go on to create a simple taxonomy of package management systems
    with language-agnostic versus language-specific as one axis
    and filesystem-oriented versus database-oriented as another,
    then discuss the crucial issue of integration between languages
    versus integration between package managers.
    (If you have ever struggled to keep C extensions to Python in sync,
    you'll share the authors' frustration that package managers don't integrate
    as cleanly as languages do.)

    Reading this paper brought the difficulties package managers face into focus for me,
    and I will use its taxonomy in the future when teaching.
    A rational reconstruction like the one in
    <a href="{{'/2021/09/21/build-systems-a-la-carte.html' | relative_url}}">yesterday's paper on build systems</a>
    would have been helpful;
    I hope someone will use this paper as a starting point and build something like that.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Package management is instrumental for programming languages and
  operating systems, and yet it is neglected by both areas as an
  implementation detail. For this reason, it lacks the same kind of
  conceptual organization: we lack terminology to classify them or to
  reason about their design trade-offs. In this paper, we share our
  experience in both OS and language-specific package manager
  development, categorizing families of package managers and
  discussing their design implications beyond particular
  implementations. We also identify possibilities in the still largely
  unexplored area of package manager interoperability.
