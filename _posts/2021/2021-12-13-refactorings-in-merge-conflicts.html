  <p>
    Merge conflicts are one of the biggest difficulties developers face when using separate development branches.
    Many developers believe that code refactoring makes the situation worse,
    but are the refactorings solely to blame?
    How big of a difference do they make when it comes to merge conflicts?
  </p>
  <p>
    Using data from roughly 3000 open-source Java software repositories,
    <cite>Mahmoudi2019</cite> examined the association between merge conflicts and 15 prominent refactoring patterns,
    and at how difficult it is to settle refactoring-related disagreements.
    They used a tool called RefactoringMiner to detect refactorings
    and investigated the relationship between refactorings and merge conflicts;
    they also developed and presented methods to detect complicated refactorings
    from refactoring and evolutionary change overlap.
    When assessing whether a conflict is caused by refactoring or by other modifications that are intertwined with refactoring,
    the authors refrained from declaring that the refactoring directly created the conflict,
    which I believe is a crucial and logical statement from the author.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Mahmoudi2019</cite> found that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Refactorings are used in 22% of merging circumstances with at least one conflicting Java file.
      More specifically, 11% of conflicting regions contain at least one refactoring.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conflicting areas with refactorings are typically more complex than conflicting regions without refactorings.
      Furthermore,
      conflicting merge cases including refactorings contain more evolutionary changes than conflicts without refactorings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conflicts are more involved in cases of "Extract Interface" and "Extract Superclass",
      albeit with minimal effect sizes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  With the rise of distributed software development, branching has
  become a popular approach that facilitates collaboration between
  software developers. One of the biggest challenges that developers
  face when using multiple development branches is dealing with merge
  conflicts. Conflicts occur when inconsistent changes happen to the
  code. Resolving these conflicts can be a cumbersome task as it
  requires prior knowledge about the changes in each of the
  development branches. A type of change that could potentially lead
  to complex conflicts is code refactoring. Previous studies have
  proposed techniques for facilitating conflict resolution in the
  presence of refactorings. However, the magnitude of the impact that
  refactorings have on merge conflicts has never been empirically
  evaluated. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on almost
  3,000 wellengineered open-source Java software repositories and
  investigate the relation between merge conflicts and 15 popular
  refactoring types. Our results show that refactoring operations are
  involved in 22% of merge conflicts, which is remarkable taking into
  account that we investigated a relatively small subset of all
  possible refactoring types. Furthermore, certain refactoring types,
  such as EXTRACT METHOD, tend to be more problematic for merge
  conflicts. Our results also suggest that conflicts that involve
  refactored code are usually more complex, compared to conflicts with
  no refactoring changes.
