    <cite>Borle2017</cite> is yet another study showing that
    test-driven development (TDD) doesn't have any significant impact.
    The authors looked at Java projects on GitHub for evidence of TDD,
    then looked for evidence that projects using TDD outperformed projects that didn't.
    Their conclusions:
    very few projects actually use it,
    and those that do don't perform any better than those that don't.

    This is our sixth post about TDD,
    and the sixth time the conclusion has been that it doesn't make a difference.
    The studies we've discussed have used different methods and different datasets,
    but have all reached the same conclusion,
    so until we see a paper indicating that TDD <em>does</em> work,
    we're going to set this topic aside.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle,
  approached with varying degrees of rigor by different process
  models. Agile process models recommend Test Driven Development (TDD)
  as a key practice for reducing costs and improving code quality. The
  objective of this work is to perform a cost-benefit analysis of this
  practice. To that end, we have conducted a comparative analysis of
  GitHub repositories that adopts TDD to a lesser or greater extent,
  in order to determine how TDD affects software development
  productivity and software quality. We classified GitHub repositories
  archived in 2015 in terms of how rigorously they practiced TDD, thus
  creating a TDD spectrum. We then matched and compared various
  subsets of these repositories on this TDD spectrum with control sets
  of equal size. The control sets were samples from all GitHub
  repositories that matched certain characteristics, and that
  contained at least one test file. We compared how the TDD sets
  differed from the control sets on the following characteristics:
  number of test files, average commit velocity, number of
  bug-referencing commits, number of issues recorded, usage of
  continuous integration, number of pull requests, and distribution of
  commits per author. We found that Java TDD projects were relatively
  rare. In addition, there were very few significant differences in
  any of the metrics we used to compare TDD-like and non-TDD projects;
  therefore, our results do not reveal any observable benefits from
  using TDD.
