    <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Oliveira2020">Oliveira2020</a>'s central proposition is straightforward:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Team leaders' perceptions are usually projects managers' primary source of information about development teams.</li>
    <li>Those perceptions can be compared to metrics based on the code programmers write or to measures of their commits to the project repository.</li>
    <li>It turns out that team leaders' perceptions correlate with the former (code) better than the latter (commits).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    It's great to see a careful study of how programmers are evaluated:
    every team does it explicitly or implicitly,
    and knowing what factors influence those evaluations can help us make them fairer.
    The authors are careful to point out that they're comparing metrics to <em>perceived</em> productivity
    rather than making any claims about programmers' actual productivity.
    The latter is probably the most difficult question in empirical software engineering:
    an entire book was recently devoted to the topic
    (<a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Sadowski2019">Sadowski2019</a>,
    which can be downloaded <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-4221-6">here</a>),
    and <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Begel2014">Begel2014</a> found that
    individual productivity is the topic programmers want studied <em>least</em>
    because they're afraid findings will be mis-used.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoyed this paper,
    but I did come away with a question and a minor concern.
    The question is how to square this with <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Rahman2013">Rahman2013</a>'s finding that
    process metrics (which roughly align with Oliveira et al's commit metrics)
    create better defect prediction models than code metrics
    (see <a href="{{'/2013/07/07/how-and-why-process-metrics-are-better.html' | relative_url}}">here</a> for a review).
    The minor concern is with one of the code metrics Oliveira et al used:
    fancy measures of source code like Halstead's are no better than simply counting lines of code
    (see <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#ElEmam2001">ElEmam2001</a>,
    summarized <a href="{{'/2011/07/07/the-confounding-effect-of-class-size-on-the-validity-of-object-oriented-metrics.html' | relative_url}}">here</a>),
    and I think it's time to set them aside.

  <strong>Context:</strong> Developer productivity is essential to the success
  of software development organizations. Team leaders use developer productivity
  information for managing tasks in a software project. Developer productivity
  metrics can be computed from software repositories data to support leaders'
  decisions. We can classify these metrics in code-based metrics, which rely on
  the amount of produced code, and commit-based metrics, which rely on commit
  activity. Although metrics can assist a leader, organizations usually neglect
  their usage and end up sticking to the leaders' subjective perceptions
  only. <strong>Objective:</strong> We aim to understand whether productivity
  metrics can complement the leaders' perceptions. We also aim to capture
  leaders' impressions about relevance and adoption of productivity metrics in
  practice. <strong>Method:</strong> This paper presents a multi-case empirical
  study performed in two organizations active for more than 18 years. Eight
  leaders of nine projects have ranked the developers of their teams by
  productivity. We quantitatively assessed the correlation of leaders' rankings
  versus metric-based rankings. As a complement, we interviewed leaders for
  qualitatively understanding the leaders' impressions about relevance and
  adoption of productivity metrics given the computed correlations.
  <strong>Results:</strong> Our quantitative data suggest a greater correlation
  of the leaders' perceptions with code-based metrics when compared to
  commit-based metrics. Our qualitative data reveal that leaders have positive
  impressions of code-based metrics and potentially would adopt
  them. <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Data triangulation of productivity metrics
  and leaders' perceptions can strengthen the organization conviction about
  productive developers and can reveal productive developers not yet perceived
  by team leaders and probably underestimated in the organization.
