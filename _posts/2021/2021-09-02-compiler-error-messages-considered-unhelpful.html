    <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Becker2019">Becker2019</a> is 34 pages long
    and has 219 entries in its bibliography—in other words,
    researchers know a <em>lot</em> about how the messages produced by today's compilers confuse people
    and how we could make them better.
    I would like everyone who is building programming tools
    (particularly ones aimed at beginners)
    to read this paper today and incorporate the findings it presents into their work tomorrow.
    Since I can't have that,
    I'll summarize the authors' recommendations,
    all of which are much richer and more specific than these brief headings:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Increase readability (in specific ways that are outlined in the paper).</li>
    <li>Reduce <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture-load">cognitive load</a>.</li>
    <li>Provide context to the error.</li>
    <li>Use a positive tone. (Yes, this actually matters…)</li>
    <li>Show examples of similar errors.</li>
    <li>Show solutions or hints.</li>
    <li>Allow dynamic interaction.</li>
    <li>Provide scaffolding for the user.</li>
    <li>Use logical argumentation (as explained in <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Barik2018">Barik2018</a>).</li>
    <li>Report errors at the right time.</li>
  </ol>

  Diagnostic messages generated by compilers and interpreters such as syntax
  error messages have been researched for over half of a century. Unfortunately,
  these messages which include error, warning, and run-time messages, present
  substantial difficulty and could be more effective, particularly for
  novices. Recent years have seen an increased number of papers in the area
  including studies on the effectiveness of these messages, improving or
  enhancing them, and their usefulness as a part of programming process data
  that can be used to predict student performance, track student progress, and
  tailor learning plans. Despite this increased interest, the long history of
  literature is quite scattered and has not been brought together in any
  digestible form. In order to help the computing education community (and
  related communities) to further advance work on programming error messages, we
  present a comprehensive, historical and state-of-the-art report on research in
  the area. In addition, we synthesise and present the existing evidence for
  these messages including the difficulties they present and their
  effectiveness. We finally present a set of guidelines, curated from the
  literature, classified on the type of evidence supporting each one
  (historical, anecdotal, and empirical). This work can serve as a starting
  point for those who wish to conduct research on compiler error messages,
  runtime errors, and warnings. We also make the bibtex file of our 300+
  reference corpus publicly available. Collectively this report and the
  bibliography will be useful to those who wish to design better messages or
  those that aim to measure their effectiveness, more effectively.

  Compilers primarily give feedback about problems to developers through the use
  of error messages. Unfortunately, developers routinely find these messages to
  be confusing and unhelpful. In this paper, we postulate that because error
  messages present poor explanations, theories of explanation—such as Toulmin's
  model of argument—can be applied to improve their quality. To understand how
  compilers should present explanations to developers, we conducted a
  comparative evaluation with 68 professional software developers and an
  empirical study of compiler error messages found in Stack Overflow questions
  across seven different programming languages. Our findings suggest that, given
  a pair of error messages, developers significantly prefer the error message
  that employs proper argument structure over a deficient argument structure
  when neither offers a resolution—but will accept a deficient argument
  structure if it provides a resolution to the problem. Human-authored
  explanations on Stack Overflow converge to one of the three argument
  structures: those that provide a resolution to the error, simple arguments,
  and extended arguments that provide additional evidence for the
  problem. Finally, we contribute three practical design principles to inform
  the design and evaluation of compiler error messages.
