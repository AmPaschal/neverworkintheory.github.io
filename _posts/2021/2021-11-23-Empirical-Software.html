    Selecting the best-suited software libraries is a crucial step in programming. 
    Developers need these libraries to write code in a systematic and timely manner. 
    Often choosing a library for a task at hand is difficult and confusing since there are gazillions of Q&A websites the developers can refer to. 
    But the problem is that these websites do not provide comprehensive features of software libraries and usually do not provide comparative data on different libraries.

    Thankfully <cite>de2018empirical</cite> investigated software metrics techniques to help solve the dilemma developers face when selecting suitable software libraries. 
    The authors of <cite>de2018empirical</cite> implemented and assessed their vision of providing an online shopping experience for selecting software libraries by presenting an in-depth empirical study on the metric-based comparison of software libraries. 
    They calculated 9 software metrics from 34 open-source Java libraries belonging to 10 popular domains (Testing, Database, XML, Utilities, Logging, ORM, JSON, Mocking, Cryptography, Security). 
    They further employed a survey of 61 participants of varied backgrounds to find the usefulness of the created metric-based comparison to choose a software library. Among their many findings:
    
     <li>
     When comparing software libraries developers found a metric-based comparison of libraries useful.
    </li>
     <li>
     Performance, Popularity, and Security were the most popular metrics while choosing an appropriate library.
    </li>
     <li>
     Metrics related to the documentation and usability of a library are highly desired by developers.
    </li>
    
    Since <cite>de2018empirical</cite> used quantifiable data extracted from multiple data sources (open-source repositories, issue-tracking systems, Stack Overflow) and 
    combined several quantifiable metrics for comparing the libraries, their approach, and findings are different and more useful as compared to earlier works.
    Hence, by utilizing a metric-based comparison of libraries and the recommendations provided by <cite>de2018empirical</cite> we can indeed alleviate the problems 
    developers face in selecting the best-suited software library to use.

  Software libraries provide a set of reusable functionality, which helps developers write code in a systematic and
timely manner. However, selecting the appropriate library to use is
often not a trivial task. AIMS: In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of software metrics in helping developers choose libraries.
Different developers care about different aspects of a library and
two developers looking for a library in a given domain may not
necessarily choose the same library. Thus, instead of directly recommending a library to use, we provide developers with a metric-based
comparison of libraries in the same domain to empower them with
the information they need to make an informed decision. METHOD:
We use software data analytics from several sources of information to create quantifiable metric-based comparisons of software
libraries. For evaluation, we select 34 open-source Java libraries
from 10 popular domains and extract nine metrics related to these
libraries. We then conduct a survey of 61 developers to evaluate
whether our proposed metric-based comparison is useful, and to
understand which metrics developers care about. RESULTS: Our
results show that developers find that the proposed technique provides useful information when selecting libraries. We observe that
developers care the most about metrics related to the popularity, security, and performance of libraries. We also find that the usefulness
of some metrics may vary according to the domain. CONCLUSIONS:
Our survey results showed that our proposed technique is useful.
We are currently building a public website for metric-based library
comparisons, while incorporating the feedback we obtained from
our survey participants.
