    Back in 2016,
    we <a href="{{'/2016/06/09/novice-programming-mistakes.html' | relative_url}}">reviewed</a>
    <a class="bibliographykey" href="/bib/#Altadmri2015">Altadmri2015</a>,
    which analyzed 37 million failed attempts by novices to compile Java programs.
    Even then it was the largest and most detailed dataset of its kind,
    but the team hasn't stopped:
    their instrumentation continues to collect information about what novices actually struggle with,
    and in doing so,
    gives us invaluable and surprising insights that we cannot get by looking at their finished code.

  <p>
    <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Brown2018">Brown2018</a> was written three years after the paper cited above.
    It explores the project's impact,
    and along the way provides a lot of advice for anyone thinking about collecting and analyzing programming data.
    The more recent <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#WeillTessier2021">WeillTessier2021</a>
    demonstrates just one use of this data
    by showing how novices' use of different language features has changed over time.
    Among their conclusions:
    "…we do see decreased exception use
    and a change in target application domains away from GUI programming
    towards text processing.
    We conclude that programming languages for novices could have fewer built-in types
    but should retain rich libraries."
    I don't know if the people building low-code and no-code tools for the general population
    are paying attention to results like these,
    but I do believe they should.

  The Blackbox project has been collecting programming activity data from users
  of BlueJ (a novice-targeted Java development environment) for nearly five
  years. The resulting dataset of more than two terabytes of data has been made
  available to interested researchers from the outset. In this paper, we assess
  the impact of the Blackbox project: we perform a mapping study to assess
  eighteen publications which have made use of the Blackbox data, and we report
  on the advantages and difficulties experienced by researchers working with
  this data, collected via a survey. We find that Blackbox has enabled pieces of
  research which otherwise would not have been possible, but there remain
  technical challenges in the analysis. Some of these---but not all---relate
  to the scale of the data. We provide suggestions for the future use of
  Blackbox, and reflections on the role of such data collection projects in
  programming research.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Java is a popular programming language for teaching at university level. BlueJ
  is a popular tool for teaching Java to beginners. We provide several analyses
  of Java use in BlueJ to answer three questions: what use is made of different
  parts of Java by beginners when learning to program; how has this pattern of
  use changed between 2013 and 2019 in a longstanding language such as Java; and
  to what extent do beginners follow the specific style that BlueJ is designed
  to guide them into? These analyses allow us to see what features are important
  in object-oriented introductory programming languages, which could inform
  language and tool designers—and see to what extent the design of these
  programming tools can have an effect on the way the language is used. We find
  that many beginners disobey the guidelines that BlueJ promotes, and that
  patterns of Java use are generally stable over time—but we do see decreased
  exception use and a change in target application domains away from GUI
  programming towards text processing. We conclude that programming languages
  for novices could have fewer built-in types but should retain rich
  libraries.
