    Have you ever developed any software without the help of Stack Overflow? I cannot even think of it. In its 13 years of journey, Stack Overflow has become a huge platform to get help in programming-related problems. It has also become a source of data for researchers to solve many software engineering problems. However, <cite>Tang2021</cite> are the first to evaluate Stack Overflow post edits with their related comments to solve the software maintenance problems. Their main goal was to find out how useful Stack Overflow comment-edit pairs are in making supporting tools for code maintenance like program repair, code recommender systems etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors used SOTorrent to automatically mine edits of code blocks in answers and marked the comment that invoked the edit. The answers were selected from five popular tags of Stack Overflow: Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python and Android, and the edit-invoker comment was selected based on three conditions: 1) the comment has been made before the edit 2) the comment contains a code term that has been added to or removed from a code snippet in the edit and 3) the editor and the commenter are different users. The authors prepared a ground truth by manual analysis and evaluated the effectiveness of their automated process on the ground truth. They gave more priority to finding out more actual pairs of comment-edit, rather than having all possible pairs in the dataset. After observing expected result, they run their automated data extraction process on the full dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors manually analyzed the extracted comment-edit pairs from different contexts to find out their usefulness. First, they explored the comment-edit pairs for tangled change. A tangled change is changing code in a single edit for resolving multiple issues raised in multiple comments. The tangled change in edits reduces the usability of the comment-edit pairs as the comment for which a part of the edit occurred becomes untraceable. Next, the authors categorized the comments of the pairs to understand in what way the dataset can be useful. Finally, the authors considered a comment-edit pair as useful if 1) an edit takes place to an existing code block so that there is a before and an after version of a code block, and 2) the comment for the edit is understandable without any context so that it is reusable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overall findings of the authors are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>The automated comment-edit mapping algorithm performs considerably well (78% precision).</li>
      <li>Edits in the comment-edit pairs are rarely tangled (11% are tangled).</li>
      <li>Nine categories are applicable for edit-invoking comments from all the Stack Overflow comment categories identified by a previous study. The most common category of the comments in the comment-edit pairs is Error.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, comment-edit pairs are not potentially very useful (27% are useful) because many edits add new code blocks or the comments are contextual. To evaluate the usefulness, the authors also manually changed the code of 15 GitHub repositories and submitted pull requests, out of which 10 were accepted. They used the before-after version of the edits to change code and provide reasoning using the comment from 15 comment-edit pairs.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In a nutshell, the authors showed a new path to the researchers to solve problems in software maintenance, more specifically code maintenance, through this study. This paper would also be a good reading for researchers who are looking for a direction to extend the work in this area.

  Code maintenance data sets typically consist of a before version of the code and an after version that contains the improvement or fix. Such data sets are important for various software engineering support tools related to code maintenance, such as program repair, code recommender systems, or Application Programming Interface (API) misuse detection. Most of the current data sets are typically constructed from mining commit history in versioncontrol systems or issues in issue-tracking systems. In this paper, we investigate whether Stack Overflow can be used as an additional source for building code maintenance data sets. Comments on Stack Overflow provide an effective way for developers to point out problems with existing answers, alternative solutions, or pitfalls. Given its crowd-sourced nature, answers are then updated to incorporate these suggestions. In this paper, we mine commentedit pairs from Stack Overflow and investigate their potential usefulness for constructing the above data sets. These comment-edit pairs have the added benefit of having concrete descriptions/explanations of why the change is needed as well as potentially having less tangled changes to deal with. We first design a technique to extract related comment-edit pairs and then qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the nature of these pairs. We find that the majority of comment-edit pairs are not tangled, but find that only 27% of the studied pairs are potentially useful for the above applications. We categorize the types of mined pairs and find that the highest ratio of useful pairs come from those categorized as Correction, Obsolete, Flaw, and Extension. These categories can provide data for both corrective and preventative maintenance activities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our extracted pairs, we submitted 15 pull requests to popular GitHub repositories, 10 of which have been accepted to widely used repositories such as Apache Beam (https://beam.apache.org/) and NLTK (https://www.nltk.org/). Our work is the first to investigate Stack Overflow commentedit pairs and opens the door for future work in this direction. Based on our findings and observations, we provide concrete suggestions on how to potentially identify a larger set of useful comment-edit pairs, which can also be facilitated by our shared data.
