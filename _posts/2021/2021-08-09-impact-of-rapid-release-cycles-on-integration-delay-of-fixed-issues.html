    Do short release cycles actually get features and bug fixes to users' more
    quickly?  To find out, the authors of this paper looked at over 70,000
    issues from the Firefox project and studied 37 programmers who contribute to
    Firefox, Eclipse, and ArgoUML.  They found that traditional (long) release
    cycles prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases
    prioritized issues that were fixed in the current cycle. In other words,
    if project switches to a rapid release cycle, people who've been waiting a
    long time for a bug fix will wait even longer. However, their results seem
    to show that rapid releases increase software stability and user feedback,
    so as with everything in engineering, the team has to make a tradeoff.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  The release frequency of software projects has increased in recent years.
  Adopters of so-called rapid releases—short release cycles, often on the order
  of weeks, days, or even hours—claim that they can deliver fixed issues (i.e.,
  implemented bug fixes and new features) to users more quickly. However, there
  is little empirical evidence to support these claims. In fact, our prior work
  shows that code integration phases may introduce delays for rapidly releasing
  projects—98% of the fixed issues in the rapidly releasing Firefox project had
  their integration delayed by at least one release. To better understand the
  impact that rapid release cycles have on the integration delay of fixed
  issues, we perform a comparative study of traditional and rapid release
  cycles. Our comparative study has two parts: (i) a quantitative empirical
  analysis of 72,114 issue reports from the Firefox project, and a (ii)
  qualitative study involving 37 participants, who are contributors of the
  Firefox, Eclipse, and ArgoUML projects. Our study is divided into quantitative
  and qualitative analyses. Quantitative analyses reveal that, surprisingly,
  fixed issues take a median of 54% (57 days) longer to be integrated in rapid
  Firefox releases than the traditional ones. To investigate the factors that
  are related to integration delay in traditional and rapid release cycles, we
  train regression models that model whether a fixed issue will have its
  integration delayed or not. Our explanatory models achieve good discrimination
  (ROC areas of 0.80–0.84) and calibration scores (Brier scores of 0.05–0.16)
  for rapid and traditional releases. Our explanatory models indicate that (i)
  traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while (ii)
  rapid releases prioritize issues that were fixed in the current release
  cycle. Complementary qualitative analyses reveal that participants' perception
  about integration delay is tightly related to activities that involve decision
  making, risk management, and team collaboration. Moreover, the allure of
  shipping fixed issues faster is a main motivator for adopting rapid release
  cycles among participants (although this motivation is not supported by our
  quantitative analysis). Furthermore, to explain why traditional releases
  deliver fixed issues more quickly, our participants point out the rush for
  integration in traditional releases and the increased time that is invested on
  polishing issues in rapid releases. Our results suggest that rapid release
  cycles may not be a silver bullet for the rapid delivery of new content to
  users. Instead, our results suggest that the benefits of rapid releases are
  increased software stability and user feedback.
