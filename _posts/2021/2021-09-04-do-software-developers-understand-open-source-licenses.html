    <cite>Almeida2017</cite>'s answer
    to the question in this paper's title is,
    "Yes when there's only one license,
    no if two or more licenses are involved."
    The authors got there by comparing developers' appraisals of various scenarios
    with the opinion of a legal expert.
    A typical scenario (in abbreviated form) is shown below;
    the options in curly braces were presented as a table in the actual questionnaire.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As the lead developer of a new product at GreatSoftware Inc.,
      Laura decided to use an existing authentication library she found on the Web called SafeAuth.
      She realizes that SafeAuth could be improved using a stronger cryptographic algorithm when storing users' information.
      The product is going to be released under a commercial software license,
      but Laura would like to release the improved version of SafeAuth as open source.
      If SafeAuth is distributed under {GNU GPL 3.0, GNU LGPL 3.0, MPL 2.0},
      would Laura and her team be allowed to release the improved version of SafeAuth under each of
      the {GNU GPL 3.0, GNU LGPL 3.0, MPL 2.0} licenses?

    Re-reading this paper almost five years after the work was done
    prompted me to check the licenses in a medium-sized JavaScript project I worked on a few months ago.
    A cursory scan finds five different licenses,
    and I'm sure that closer inspection would turn up at least one or two others
    as well as a bunch of projects with no explicit license at all.
    As with so much of modern software,
    licensing seems to work primarily because we don't look at it too closely.

      but played no role in the actual analysis.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Software provided under open source licenses is widely used, from forming
  high-profile stand-alone applications (e.g., Mozilla Firefox) to being
  embedded in commercial offerings (e.g., network routers). Despite the high
  frequency of use of open source licenses, there has been little work about
  whether software developers understand the open source licenses they use. To
  our knowledge, only one survey has been conducted, which focused on which
  licenses developers choose and when they encounter problems with licensing
  open source software. To help fill the gap of whether or not developers
  understand the open source licenses they use, we conducted a survey that posed
  development scenarios involving three popular open source licenses (GNU GPL
  3.0, GNU LGPL 3.0 and MPL 2.0) both alone and in combination. The 375
  respondents to the survey, who were largely developers, gave answers
  consistent with those of a legal expert's opinion in 62% of 42 cases. Although
  developers clearly understood cases involving one license, they struggled when
  multiple licenses were involved. An analysis of the quantitative and
  qualitative results of the study indicate a need for tool support to help
  guide developers in understanding this critical information attached to
  software components.
