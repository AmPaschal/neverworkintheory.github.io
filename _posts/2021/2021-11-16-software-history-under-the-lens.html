    If you have ever wondered why and how developers analyze software
    history, or if you are a tool builder who is unsure of which
    features to include in your software history tool,
    then <cite>Codoban2015</cite> may have some answers for you.  They
    interviewed 14 experienced developers to examine developers'
    motivation, needs, and strategy for software history analysis, as
    well as the challenges they face during analysis. The authors then
    surveyed 217 people to extend these interviews' findings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Codoban2015</cite> found that reasons like debugging,
    reverse engineering, understanding the ongoing work, keeping up
    with changes, or analyzing the impact of a change can motivate the
    developers to analyze the software history. Moreover, for
    analysis, developers follow strategies like narrowing down the
    search space for commit by looking at the task, followed by
    identifying interesting commits, and finally analyzing the intent
    of the commit.

    The paper also talk about the challenges faced by developers in
    analyzing the software history. For example, developers always
    suffer simultaneously from both a lack of informative commit
    messages <em>and</em> information overload.  Limited tool
    functionality, understanding the reasons for changes, and tracing
    older versions are also problems; when asked, they want to be able
    to filter changes, group commits, get selective change
    notifications and trace previous versions in a better way.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the authors did not just look at where we are: they also
    introduced what they call a 3-lens history model that suggests
    measures that tool builders can use to ensure their tool does
    everything developers want.  This model subsumes the isolated
    measures developed by previous researchers, and introduces 3 lenses;
	Immediate lens, Awareness lens and Archaeology lens. The Immediate 
	lens suggests to track uncommitted changes,the Awareness lens focuses
	on understanding the latest changes and the Archaeology lens
	helps in implementing features to recover knowledge from software
	history.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Despite software history being indispensable for developers, there
  is little empirical knowledge about how they examine software
  history. Without such knowledge, researchers and tool builders are
  in danger of making wrong assumptions and building inadequate
  tools. In this paper we present an in-depth empirical study about
  the motivations developers have for examining software history, the
  strategies they use, and the challenges they encounter. To learn
  these, we interviewed 14 experienced developers from industry, and
  then extended our findings by surveying 217 developers. We found
  that history does not begin with the latest commit but with
  uncommitted changes. Moreover, we found that developers had
  different motivations for examining recent and old history. Based on
  these findings we propose 3-LENS HISTORY, a novel unified model for
  reasoning about software history.
