<div class="review">
  <p>
    Back in 2011 <a href="{{'/2011/06/30/lets-go-to-the-whiteboard.html' | relative_url}}">we reviewed</a>
    <cite>Cherubini2007</cite>,
    which found that software designers almost always used whiteboard sketches
    as a transient supplement to short-term memory
    rather than for formal, archival purposes:
    the drawing's purpose was to help them think in the moment
    rather than to act as something like a blueprint or circuit diagram.
    Two years later <a href="{{'/2013/06/13/uml-in-practice-2.html' | relative_url}}">we reviewed</a>
    the award-winning <cite>Petre2013</cite>,
    which found that most professionals either don't use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) at all
    or use parts of it in the informal, <em>ad hoc</em> ways described in <cite>Cherubini2007</cite>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Mangano2015</cite> reinforced these findings by studying 4000 events
    recorded during 14 hours of design activity by 8 pairs of professional software designers.
    They found that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      sketches serve as a rich medium for supporting design conversations;
    </li>
    <li>
      designers often use general-purpose notations
      (e.g., generic boxes and arrows whose meaning is made up on the spot);
    </li>
    <li>
      they introduce new elements or re-purpose existing ones on the fly;
    </li>
    <li>
      they constantly shift focus between sketches,
      using groups of sketches together that contain complementary information;
      and
    </li>
    <li>
      sketches play an important role in supporting mental simulation,
      review of progress,
      and consideration of alternatives,
      but these activities often leave no trace.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All of which leads to several questions:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Are the shape palettes diagramming tools like <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a>
      trying to support a way of working that most developers don't actually use?
      (Even when I have a palette of standard-compliant UML shapes or flowchart elements,
      almost all of my diagrams just use boxes and arrows.)
    </li>
    <li>
      As touch-screen devices become more common—in particular,
      as laptops with touch screens become ubiquitous and/or people use tablets with keyboards
      as gateways to cloud computing engines—will
      developers use freehand sketching tools for <em>ad hoc</em> communication
      in online meetings?
      (I've been in meetings during COVID where people held hand-drawn sketches up to their webcam
      to share their ideas…)
    </li>
    <li>
      If the answer to #2 is "yes",
      (how) can general-purpose sketching tools be enhanced
      to support the things programmers actually want to do?
      "OCR the shapes to automatically turn sketches into UML class diagrams"
      feels wrong-headed (see #1);
      is there anything else tool-builders could do?
    </li>
  </ol>

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Whiteboard sketches play a crucial role in software development,
  helping to support groups of designers in reasoning about a software
  design problem at hand. However, little is known about these
  sketches and how they support design 'in the moment', particularly
  in terms of the relationships among sketches, visual syntactic
  elements within sketches, and reasoning activities. To address this
  gap, we analyzed 14 hours of design activity by eight pairs of
  professional software designers, manually coding over 4000 events
  capturing the introduction of visual syntactic elements into
  sketches, focus transitions between sketches, and reasoning
  activities. Our findings indicate that sketches serve as a rich
  medium for supporting design conversations. Designers often use
  general-purpose notations. Designers introduce new syntactic
  elements to record aspects of the design, or re-purpose sketches as
  the design develops. Designers constantly shift focus between
  sketches, using groups of sketches together that contain
  complementary information. Finally, sketches play an important role
  in supporting several types of reasoning activities (mental
  simulation, review of progress, consideration of alternatives). But
  these activities often leave no trace and rarely lead to sketch
  creation. We discuss the implications of these and other findings
  for the practice of software design at the whiteboard and for the
  creation of new electronic software design sketching
  tools.
