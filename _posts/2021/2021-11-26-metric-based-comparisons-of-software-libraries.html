    Selecting the best software libraries for a task is a crucial step in programming,
    but often difficult and confusing
    because there are gazillions of Q&amp;A websites with conflicting or out-of-date advice.
    These websites do not provide comprehensive descriptions of libraries' features
    and usually do not provide comparative data on different libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Lopez2018</cite> tackled this problem
    by implementing and assessing a metric-based comparison of software libraries.
    They calculated nine software metrics for 34 open-source Java libraries
    belonging to ten popular domains,
    such as testing, databases, and cryptography.
    They then surveyed 61 participants of varied backgrounds
    to determine how useful the metric-based comparison was.
    They found that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Developers found  a metric-based comparison of libraries useful.
    </li>
    <li>
      Performance, Popularity, and Security were the most popular metrics when choosing a libraries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Metrics related to the documentation and usability of a library were highly desired.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While there are good reasons to be skeptical about software metrics in general
    (see <a href="{{'/2011/07/07/the-confounding-effect-of-class-size-on-the-validity-of-object-oriented-metrics.html' | relative_url}}">this post</a> for discussion),
    <cite>Lopez2018</cite> used data extracted from multiple sources
    (open source repositories, issue-tracking systems, and Stack Overflow)
    and combined several metrics for comparing the libraries,
    which makes their approach and findings more useful than earlier work in this area.

  Software libraries provide a set of reusable functionality, which
  helps developers write code in a systematic and timely
  manner. However, selecting the appropriate library to use is often
  not a trivial task. AIMS: In this paper, we investigate the
  usefulness of software metrics in helping developers choose
  libraries.Different developers care about different aspects of a
  library and two developers looking for a library in a given domain
  may not necessarily choose the same library. Thus, instead of
  directly recommending a library to use, we provide developers with a
  metric-based comparison of libraries in the same domain to empower
  them with the information they need to make an informed
  decision. METHOD:We use software data analytics from several sources
  of information to create quantifiable metric-based comparisons of
  software libraries. For evaluation, we select 34 open-source Java
  libraries from 10 popular domains and extract nine metrics related
  to these libraries. We then conduct a survey of 61 developers to
  evaluate whether our proposed metric-based comparison is useful, and
  to understand which metrics developers care about. RESULTS: Our
  results show that developers find that the proposed technique
  provides useful information when selecting libraries. We observe
  that developers care the most about metrics related to the
  popularity, security, and performance of libraries. We also find
  that the usefulness of some metrics may vary according to the
  domain. CONCLUSIONS:Our survey results showed that our proposed
  technique is useful.We are currently building a public website for
  metric-based library comparisons, while incorporating the feedback
  we obtained from our survey participants.
