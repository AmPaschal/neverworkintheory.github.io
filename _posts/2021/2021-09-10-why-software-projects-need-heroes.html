  <p>
    Forty-five years ago,
    Fred Brooks advocated a "chief programmer" model of development
    similar to the "chief surgeon" model used in most hospitals.
    It didn't catch on—at least not formally—but
    as <cite>Majumder2019</cite> shows,
    many projects use it in practice.
    Their research questions and answers are:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>How common are hero projects?</em>
      They define a "hero project" as one in which 5% or fewer of developers
      are responsible for 95% or more of interactions.
      They don't just consider commits:
      looking at both the code interaction graph and the social interaction graph,
      they find that 80% of the projects they looked at on GitHub fit into this category.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>What impact does heroism have on code quality?</em>
      Heroes commit far fewer bugs than non-heroes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Does team size alter these results?</em>
      No.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The authors then go on to say that
    if two sections of code communicate
    but the programmers of those sections don't,
    the code section is more likely to be buggy.
    They conclude that:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The usual response to the above argument is to improve communication
    by "smoothing it out", i.e. by deprecating heroes
    since…that encourages more communication across an entire project…
    [Our] results…suggest that it is time to explore another response:
    the best way to reduce communication overhead and to decrease defects is
    to <em>centralize the communicators</em> [emphasis in original].
    In our data, commits with lower defects come from
    the small number of hero developers who have learned how to talk to more people.
    Hence,
    we would encourage more research into better methods
    for rapid, high-volume, communication in a one-to-many setting
    (where the "one" is the hero and the "many" are everyone else).
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I don't like this conclusion:
    elitism and exclusion are serious structural problems in tech,
    and the history of meritocracy shows that if hero worship is condoned,
    the heroes will wind up being the confident,
    the well-connected,
    and those with preparatory privilege
    more often than the most intelligent or capable.
    However,
    it would be hypocritical to ask software developers to pay attention to research
    and then dismiss an uncomfortable result.
    As the authors say,
    more research is needed.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  A "hero" project is one where 80% or more of the contributions are
  made by the 20% of the developers. Those developers are called
  "hero" developers. In the literature, heroes projects are deprecated
  since they might cause bottlenecks in development and
  communication. However, there is little empirical evidence on this
  matter. Further, recent studies show that such hero projects are
  very prevalent. Accordingly, this paper explores the effect of
  having heroes in project, from a code quality perspective by
  analyzing 1000+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis,
  this study finds that (a) majority of the projects are hero
  projects; and (b)the commits from "hero developers" (who contribute
  most to the code) result in far fewer bugs than other
  developers. That is, contrary to the literature, heroes are standard
  and very useful part of modern open source projects.
