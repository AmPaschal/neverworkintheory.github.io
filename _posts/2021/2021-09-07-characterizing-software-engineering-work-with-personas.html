  <p>
    I've been using <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas">learner personas</a>
    to sharpen my conception of who I'm teaching for almost a decade,
    but until I read <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Ford2017">Ford2017</a> a few years ago
    it never occurred to me that (a) programmer personas would be just as valuable
    and (b) they could be empirically grounded in this way.
    Ford et al adapted a pre-existing taxonomy of knowledge workers' tasks
    to describe what programmers do,
    used interviews and surveys to find out how often programmers do them,
    and then clustered the results to come up with seven personas
    (all descriptions taken directly from the paper):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Acantha, the Autonomist Acumen</em> is known for her autonomy and keen
      abilities to make good judgments when writing code. Her long tenure as a
      software engineer has supported her decision making abilities. She spends
      the majority of her time writing code independently on personal projects
      and also spends a significant amount of time working on internal
      projects. On average, more than 20% of her time is spent in the Authoring
      knowledge worker action.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Lilo, the Continuous Learner</em> is known for her interest in
      learning and getting adapted to a new team early in her career. She
      spends, on average, more than 23% of her time in the Learning knowledge
      worker action. She takes a great interest in watching online lectures to
      brush up on the latest frameworks and technologies that she may be able to
      add to a new project. At this stage in her career she is often assigned
      tasks rather than choosing tasks to work on. Though she may be an
      entry-level engineer with little professional experience at the large
      company, she takes an initiative to get caught up quickly on team
      projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Isabelle, the Investigator</em> is best known for being the top
      investigator on her team. She spends the most time, over 30% on average,
      in the Analyzing knowledge worker action. She spends much time in the
      trenches of projects debugging and making sense of code. Isabelle recently
      changed from being one of the top experts on her team to being a novice in
      her new team. However, this has not impeded her success as she was able
      transition smoothly and adapt the same techniques of connecting with peer
      developers to ensure success on her new team.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Cameron, the Communicator</em> is considered to be a communicator
      because of her ability to distribute her time evenly and early in her
      career while securing the logistics of her work environment. She is able
      to spread her time across all knowledge worker actions well. However,
      since she is so early in her career she also seeks guidance from her
      program manager and others on how to approach tasks. Cameron spends a lot
      of time communicating about how to set up and approach her work through
      emails, meetings, reports, and presentations, but that sometimes gets in
      the way of writing code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Iman, the Interactive</em> is known for her activity with
      collaborative code writing style but also for her dynamic level of
      interaction that goes on within her team in terms of the Co-authoring
      knowledge worker action. Aside from being very helpful in code reviews,
      much of her tasks to complete come from everyone else. On average, many of
      her tasks come from management questions, source code from other
      engineers, and also spontaneous conversations within her team.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Ava, the Advisor</em> is known for the high value she places on being
      helpful to others and giving feedback. On average, she spends over 20% of
      her time offering feedback. She has significantly more professional
      experience, identifies as an expert, and puts out more fires than others
      when her team is in need of an emergency product fix. Her professional
      experience shines through the most as she has more years at her large
      company than others. Her ability to put out fires and help the team in
      unplanned emergency situations demonstrates how often she gets interrupted
      while working.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Ciara, the Team Coder</em> embodies this idea of being a team coder
      for her immense amount of time in the Co-authoring knowledge worker action
      (sometimes over 40%). She spends a significant amount of time producing
      code for her large company with a team by her side. Her major tasks are to
      sift through bug reports and fix them with source code check-ins. Ciara
      does not spend a lot of time in emails, meetings, or presentations because
      she is busy testing bug fixes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The authors don't claim that personas or the boundaries between them are
    fixed: for example, they point out that nobody starts as an expert and say
    that, "Participants…mentioned…having to switch between modes on a
    project. Some emphasized that it depends on what project has demanding
    deadlines at that particular time." Having these personas is still very
    useful as a way to help people think about why teams are and aren't working
    and how different individuals' careers might develop.

  Mistaking versatility for universal skills, some companies tend to categorize
  all software engineers the same not knowing a difference exists. For example,
  a company may select one of many software engineers to complete a task, later
  finding that the engineer's skills and style do not match those needed to
  successfully complete that task. This can result in delayed task completion
  and demonstrates that a one-size fits all concept should not apply to how
  software engineers work. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of
  different software engineers and their working styles we interviewed 21
  participants and surveyed 868 software engineers at a large software company
  and asked them about their work in terms of knowledge worker actions. We
  identify how tasks, collaboration styles, and perspectives of autonomy can
  significantly effect different approaches to software engineering work. To
  characterize differences, we describe empirically informed personas on how
  they work. Our defined software engineering personas include those with
  focused debugging abilities, engineers with an active interest in learning,
  experienced advisors who serve as experts in their role, and more. Our study
  and results serve as a resource for building products, services, and tools
  around these software engineering personas.
