    If you have ever wondered why and how developers analyze software history, or if you are a tool builder who is unsure of which features to include in your software history tool, then you are in luck because <cite>Codoban et al. [2015]</cite> conducted a study in which they interviewed 14 experienced developers to examine developers’ motivation, needs, and strategy for software history analysis, as well as the challenges they face during analysis. The authors also surveyed 217 participants to extend the findings of these interviews.

	<p>
	<cite>Codoban et al. [2015]</cite> found that reasons like debugging, reverse engineering, understanding the ongoing work, keeping up with changes, or analyzing the impact of a change can motivate the developers to analyze the software history. Moreover, for analysis, developers follow strategies like narrowing down the search space for commit by looking at the task, followed by identifying interesting commits and then finally analyzing the intent of the commit. Additionally, the authors also talk about the challenges faced by developers in analyzing the software history. For example, developers always suffer from problems like lack of informative commit messages, information overload, limited tool functionality, understanding changes, or tracing the older versions. Finally, developers were also questioned about the things they desire in a software history tool, and it was found that developers prefer the ability to filter changes, group commits, get selective change notifications and trace previous versions in a better way.

	Furthermore, the authors did not stop at the survey and introduced a 3-lens history model which suggests measures that can be used by tool developers to make sure their tool covers all the developers’ desired features. Contrarily, prior research only provided a few isolated measures which are all covered under the 3-lens history model introduced in this paper. 
	</p>
	<p>
	To conclude, I think this paper is novel, unique and the 3-lens history model provided by the authors can be used by researchers and tool builders to focus on different aspects of software history and improve how software history is examined.

<blockquote class="abstract">
Despite software history being indispensable for developers, there is little empirical knowledge about how they examine software history. Without such knowledge, researchers and tool builders are in danger of making wrong assumptions and building inadequate tools. In this paper we present an in-depth empirical study about the motivations developers have for examining software history, the strategies they use, and the challenges they encounter. To learn these, we interviewed 14 experienced developers from industry, and then extended our findings by surveying 217 developers. We found that history does not begin with the latest commit but with uncommitted changes. Moreover, we found that developers had different motivations for examining recent and old history. Based on these findings we propose 3-LENS HISTORY, a novel unified model for reasoning about software history.
