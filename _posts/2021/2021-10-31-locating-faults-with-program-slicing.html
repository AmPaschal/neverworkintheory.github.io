    Most programmers spend more time debugging than writing new code,
    but books and courses on debugging are few and far between,
    and testing tools to help people figure out if code is buggy or not
    are much more common than ones to help them figure out where the bugs are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully, there is a growing body of research on isolating and repairing bugs.
    One interesting approach is statistical fault localization:
    given a set of tests that pass and another set that fail,
    look at the correlation between statements that are executed by failing tests
    but <em>not</em> by passing tests
    in order to identify problematic regions.
    Another is dynamic slicing:
    starting from the statement where the fault occurred,
    trace backward recursively through a trace of the program's execution
    to find where the variables used in that statement were set
    to narrow the search space for the error.
    <cite>Zeller2009</cite> and the more recent <cite>Zeller2021</cite>
    are excellent introductions to these techniques and others;
    what <cite>Soremekun2021</cite> explored was how effective statistical methods are
    when compared to dynamic program slicing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at over 450 bugs in 46 open source C programs,
    they found that slicing worked better when a single statement was responsible for the problem,
    but statistical analysis worked better when the fault was caused by multiple errors interacting.
    However,
    a hybrid approach was better than either on its own,
    regardless of which statistical method was used.
    I hope these findings will spur the developers of IDEs and testing harnesses
    to include support for both kinds of debugging.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Statistical fault localization is an easily deployed technique for
  quickly determining candidates for faulty code locations. If a human
  programmer has to search the fault beyond the top candidate
  locations, though, more traditional techniques of following
  dependencies along dynamic slices may be better suited. In a large
  study of 457 bugs (369 single faults and 88 multiple faults) in 46
  open source C programs, we compare the effectiveness of statistical
  fault localization against dynamic slicing. For single faults, we
  find that dynamic slicing was eight percentage points more effective
  than the best performing statistical debugging formula; for 66% of
  the bugs, dynamic slicing finds the fault earlier than the best
  performing statistical debugging formula. In our evaluation, dynamic
  slicing is more effective for programs with single fault, but
  statistical debugging performs better on multiple faults. Best
  results, however, are obtained by a hybrid approach : If programmers
  first examine at most the top five most suspicious locations from
  statistical debugging, and then switch to dynamic slices, on
  average, they will need to examine 15% (30 lines) of the code. These
  findings hold for 18 most effective statistical debugging formulas
  and our results are independent of the number of faults (i.e. single
  or multiple faults) and error type (i.e. artificial or real
  errors).
