  <p>
    Three studies from 2017 gave conflicting about the readability of short and
    long names in programs.
    <a class="bibliographykey" href="/bib/#Scanniello2017">Scanniello2017</a> et
    al found no difference in development effort or efficiency when using
    abbreviated identifier names as opposed to full names. This is consistent
    with the findings of <span class="bibliographykey">Beniamini2017</span>,
    which looked specifically at single-letter variable names and found that,
    even in controlled experiments, there was no different in comprehension.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, <span class="bibliographykey">Hofmeister2017</span> found that
    words outperformed both single letters and abbreviations (which performed
    the same). The difference was still fairly small (19%), so on balance
    this issue probably falls under the heading of "not worth worrying about".

    We carried out a family of controlled experiments to investigate
    whether the use of abbreviated identifier names, with respect to
    full-word identifier names, affects fault fixing in C and Java
    source code. This family consists of an original (or baseline)
    controlled experiment and three replications. We involved 100
    participants with different backgrounds and experiences in
    total. Overall results suggested that there is no difference in
    terms of effort, effectiveness, and efficiency to fix faults, when
    source code contains either only abbreviated or only full-word
    identifier names. We also conducted a qualitative study to
    understand the values, beliefs, and assumptions that inform and
    shape fault fixing when identifier names are either abbreviated or
    full-word. We involved in this qualitative study six professional
    developers with 1--3 years of work experience. A number of insights
    emerged from this qualitative study and can be considered a useful
    complement to the quantitative results from our family of
    experiments. One of the most interesting insights is that
    developers, when working on source code with abbreviated identifier
    names, adopt a more methodical approach to identify and fix faults
    by extending their focus point and only in a few cases do they
    expand abbreviated identifiers.

  It is widely accepted that variable names in computer programs should be
  meaningful, and that this aids program comprehension. "Meaningful" is commonly
  interpreted as favoring long descriptive names. However, there is at least
  some use of short and even single-letter names: using i in loops is very
  common, and we show (by extracting variable names from 1000 popular GitHub
  projects in 5 languages) that some other letters are also widely used. In
  addition, controlled experiments with different versions of the same functions
  (specifically, different variable names) failed to show significant
  differences in ability to modify the code. Finally, an online survey showed
  that certain letters are strongly associated with certain types and
  meanings. This implies that a single letter can in fact convey meaning. The
  conclusion from all this is that single letter variables can indeed be used
  beneficially in certain cases, leading to more concise code.

  Developers spend the majority of their time comprehending code, a process in
  which identifier names play a key role. Although many identifier naming styles
  exist, they often lack an empirical basis and it is not quite clear whether
  short or long identifier names facilitate comprehension. In this paper, we
  investigate the effect of different identifier naming styles (letters,
  abbreviations, words) on program comprehension, and whether these effects
  arise because of their length or their semantics. We conducted an experimental
  study with 72 professional C# developers, who looked for defects in
  source-code snippets. We used a within-subjects design, such that each
  developer saw all three versions of identifier naming styles and we measured
  the time it took them to find a defect. We found that words lead to, on
  average, 19% faster comprehension speed compared to letters and abbreviations,
  but we did not find a significant difference in speed between letters and
  abbreviations. The results of our study suggest that defects in code are more
  difficult to detect when code contains only letters and abbreviations. Words
  as identifier names facilitate program comprehension and can help to save
  costs and improve software quality.
