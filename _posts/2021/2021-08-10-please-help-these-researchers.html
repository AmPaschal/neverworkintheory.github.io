  <p>
    Many of the studies we report on here depend on surveys and interviews.
    If you'd like to see more of them, please take a few minutes to help these researchers—thanks
    in advance for your help.

      Alexander Serebrenik, Pavlína Wurzel Gonçalves, Gul Calikli and Alberto Bacchelli are conducting a survey about skills required to perform a code review. The survey can be found <a href="https://uzh.ch/zi/cl/umfragen/index.php/657931?lang=en">here</a>.

      Together with Felipe Ebert, Nicole Novielli, Fernando Castor, and Christoph Treude, Alexander would also like to learn about experiences of open source developers when reviewing and discussing code changes.
      The idea would be to build a bot recording useful parts of code review discussions as source code comments. You can contribute <a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=R_J9zM5gD0qddXBM9g78ZMAMI9bGIIZAmDOD8RQWvxNUQU5PQVVFV1hCNjJNVzhQMVdFTkU3OTVLNS4u&fbclid=IwAR2tvAAWqTMa_SsTAsxS1qt9LMZGP2-fuhyNEt_plgZrF4TTCU-HSkvrjGA">here</a>.

      Finally, Alexander, Niloofar Mansoor, Bonita Sharif, and Tukaram Muskee would like to know how C programmers are inspecting static analysis alarms so that they can build better static analysis tools in the future.
      The study involves answering questionnaire and performing programming tasks. It will take 1.5–2 hours, and participants will receive $8.00/hour in the form of an Amazon gift card. You can sign up <a href="https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6KySvTGvvzDzgzk">here</a>.
