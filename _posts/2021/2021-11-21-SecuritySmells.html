    Infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts is used by practitioners to provision servers and development environments. 
    Practitioners may unintentionally add security smells while writing IaC programs. 
    The purpose of this paper is to help practitioners avoid insecure coding practices when developing infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, 
    by conducting an empirical study of seven security smells, 
    and developing a static analysis tool called Security Linter for Infrastructure as Code Scripts (SLIC) 
    to automatically identify the occurrence of these security smells in 15,232 IAC scripts.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    For the data collection, the authors have collected 1,726 Puppet scripts from the master branches of 
    74 repositories which were from organizations Mozilla, Open-stack, and Wikimedia Commons. 
    After performing a qualitative analysis on 1,726 IAC scripts, authors have also generalized the 
    pipeline by making a tool called Security Linter for Infrastructure as Code Scripts (SLIC) to 
    identify the occurrence of each smell on 15,2322 IAC collected from 293 open source repositories.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the evaluation of the detection accuracy of SLIC, 
    authors constructed an oracle dataset consisting of 140 scripts which are being manually 
    checked for security smells by 28 graduate students at each script is reviewed by at least two 
    students. fairâ€™. In the case of disagreements between raters for 61 scripts, the first author 
    resolved the disagreements. For the oracle dataset, the average precision and recall of SLIC are 0.99.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some of the challenges mentioned in the paper focus on seven security smells acknowledging that other 
    security smells may exist. In the future, authors will aim to expand their investigation if more
    security smells exist. Furthermore, because the current dataset is focused on Puppet, which
     utilizes declarative language, it may not apply to IaC scripts that use imperative language.
  </p>
<p>
  Overall the authors have considered seven security smells: 
  <ul>
   <li>admin by default</li>
   <li>empty password</li>
   <li>hard-coded secret</li>
   <li>invalid IP address binding</li>
   <li> suspicious comment </li>
   <li> use of HTTP without TLS</li>
   <li>use of weak cryptography algorithms </li>
 </ul>
 and analyzed 15,232 IaC scripts to determine which security smells occur and used a tool called SLIC, 
 to automatically identify security smells that occur in IaC scripts.

  Practitioners use infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts
  to provision servers and development environments. While developing
  IaC scripts, practitioners may inadvertently introduce
  security smells. Security smells are recurring coding patterns that
  are indicative of security weakness and can potentially lead to
  security breaches. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners
  avoid insecure coding practices while developing infrastructure as
  code (IaC) scripts through an empirical study of security smells in
  IaC scripts.
