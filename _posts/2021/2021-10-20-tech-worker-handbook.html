  The bigger tech companies get,
  the harder they work to avoid responsibility for the harm they cause.
  From

    stirring up genocidal hatred
  </a>,
  the executives who run tech companies
  work overtime to avoid facing consequences for their actions.
  To date,
  most elected officials seem bewildered by the scale and speed of the problem;
  when companies <em>are</em> held accountable,
  it's often because
  a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043377310/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-congress">whistleblower</a>
  with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667247/google-pay-disparity-temp-workers-underpaid-sec-whistleblower">inside knowledge</a>
  has come forward,
  but people who do that often face
  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean">sustained harassment</a>
  or worse.

  <a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org/">The Tech Worker's Handbook</a> is
  "â€¦a collection of resources for tech workers
  who are looking to make more informed decisions about
  whether to speak out on issues that are in the public interest."
  Its four sections address legal questions,
  how to speak to the media,
  personal security,
  and how to tell your own story.
  While some parts are US-centric,
  I believe that going through the guide with undergraduate students
  would be much more engaging than talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac-25</a>,
  and more likely to be useful as well.
  I'm planning to revise <em><a href="https://buildtogether.tech/">Building Software Together</a></em>
  to include this material;
  if you are already teaching it,
  or something like it,
  I'd be grateful if you'd share your experiences.
