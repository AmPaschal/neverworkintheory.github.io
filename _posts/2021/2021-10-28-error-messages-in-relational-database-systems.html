<blockquote class="abstract">
  The database and the database management system (DBMS) are two of
  the main components of any information system. Structured Query
  Language (SQL) is the most popular query language for retrieving
  data from the database, as well as for many other data management
  tasks. During system development and maintenance, software
  developers use a considerable amount of time to interpret compiler
  error messages. The quality of these error messages has been
  demonstrated to affect software development effectiveness, and
  correctly formulating queries and fixing them when needed is an
  important task for many software developers. In this study, we set
  out to investigate how participants (N = 152) experienced the
  qualities of error messages of four popular DBMSs in terms of error
  message effectiveness, perceived usefulness for finding and fixing
  errors, and error recovery confidence. Our results show differences
  between the DBMSs by three of the four metrics, and indicate a
  discrepancy between objective effectiveness and subjective
  usefulness. The results suggest that although error messages have
  perceived differences in terms of usefulness for finding and fixing
  errors, these differences may not necessarily result in differences
  in query fixing success rates.
