  <p>
    As a computing educator and an occasional software library developer I
    often feel that a big portion of novice frustration when coding can be
    resolved by developers writing “better” error messages.
    <cite>Tao2021</cite> provides evidence that both dashes my dreams, but
    also provides actionable suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors mined errors that were <code>raise</code>ed by six popular
    Python data science libraries: NumPy, Panadas, SciPy, scikit-learn,
    TensorFlow, and Gensim. With this large list of possible errors, they found
    possible fixes by doing what most people I know would do: search that
    error message on StackOverflow! They categorize each error messages as
    being either <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>uninformative</strong>, or
    <strong>misleading</strong>. Note that people still asked for help for
    resolving “clear” messages under this categorization.
  </p>
  <p>
    They conclude that some error messages are <strong>inevitably misleading
    or uninformative</strong>, due to the libraries being unable to
    understand <strong>user intent</strong> or do not have access to
    understand <strong>external errors</strong> such as mistakes that occur
    outside of the library, but are detected once interacting with the library
    code.
  </p>
  <p>
    All hope is not lost; The authors provide a few suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <strong>library users</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the library does not understand your ultimate goal,
        and this makes some direct explanations impossible;
        with this in mind:</li>
    <li>improve your understating of the problem domain at hand</li>
    <li>improve your understanding of the programming language</li>
    <li>read relevant library documentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For <strong>library developers</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>have your library fail fast and add robust error handling to prevent
      internal errors from creeping out of the library code and confusing
      users</li>
    <li>error messages should focus on “completeness”, such as providing the
        relevant runtime values that caused an error</li>
    <li>add actionable instructions on how to resolve the error</li>
    <li>instead of stating that some value or state is not allowed,
        state what <em>is</em> allowed</li>
    <li>messages that are clear to developers are not always clear to end users</li>
  </ul>

    Error messages are critical starting points for debugging. Unfortunately,
    they seem to be notoriously cryptic, confusing, and uninformative. Yet, it
    still remains a mystery why error messages receive such bad reputations,
    especially given that they are merely very short pieces of natural
    language text. In this paper, we empirically demystify the causes and
    fixes of “bad” error messages, by qualitatively studying 201 Stack
    Overflow threads and 335 GitHub issues. We specifically focus on error
    messages encountered in data science development, which is an increasingly
    important but not well studied domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    We found that the causes of “bad” error messages are far more complicated
    than poor phrasing or flawed articulation of error message content. Many
    error messages are inherently and inevitably misleading or uninformative,
    since libraries do not know user intentions and cannot “see” external
    errors. Fixes to error-message-related issues mostly involve source code
    changes, while exclusive message content updates only take up a small
    portion. In addition, whether an error message is informative or helpful
    is not always clear-cut; even error messages that clearly pinpoint faults
    and resolutions can still cause confusion for certain users. These
    findings thus call for a more in-depth investigation on how error messages
    should be evaluated and improved in the future.
