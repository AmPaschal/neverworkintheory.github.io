  <p>
    I've looked back at the end of every software project I've ever been on and thought,
    "If I'd known then what I know now, I'd have been done in half the time."
    Despite this,
    I've never thought carefully about exactly where all the time went and why so much of it felt wasted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Sedano2017">Sedano2017</a> watched eight projects
    over a period of almost two and a half years
    and categorized the waste they saw.
    They're careful to say that their findings may not generalize,
    but their taxonomy is still a valuable checklist for any team that's trying to figure out
    how to be more efficient.

  Context: Since software development is a complex socio-technical activity that
  involves coordinating different disciplines and skill sets, it provides ample
  opportunities for waste to emerge. Waste is any activity that produces no
  value for the customer or user. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to
  identify and describe different types of waste in software
  development. Method: Following Constructivist Grounded Theory, we conducted a
  two-year five-month participant-observation study of eight software
  development projects at Pivotal, a software development consultancy. We also
  interviewed 33 software engineers, interaction designers, and product
  managers, and analyzed one year of retrospection topics. We iterated between
  analysis and theoretical sampling until achieving theoretical
  saturation. Results: This paper introduces the first empirical waste
  taxonomy. It identifies nine wastes and explores their causes, underlying
  tensions, and overall relationship to the waste taxonomy found in Lean
  Software Development. Limitations: Grounded Theory does not support
  statistical generalization. While the proposed taxonomy appears widely
  applicable, organizations with different software development cultures may
  experience different waste types. Conclusion: Software development projects
  manifest nine types of waste: building the wrong feature or product,
  mismanaging the backlog, rework, unnecessarily complex solutions, extraneous
  cognitive load, psychological distress, waiting/multitasking, knowledge loss,
  and ineffective communication.
