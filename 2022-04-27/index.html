title: "It Will Never Work in Theory: Live!"
---
<p>
  People have been building complex software for over sixty years.
  Researchers have been studying what they make and how they make it for almost as long,
  but most working programmers don't know what they have discovered,
  or even what kinds of questions they can answer.
